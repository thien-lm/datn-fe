    type: "ENFJ",
    name: "Extraverted Intuitive Feeling Judging",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Feeling with Introverted Intuition",
    epithet: "The Giver",
    description: `As an ENFJ, you're primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things according to
how you feel about them, or how they fit into your personal value system. Your secondary mode is internal,
where you take things in primarily via your intuition.
ENFJs are people-focused individuals. They live in the world of people possibilities. More so than any
other type, they have excellent people skills. They understand and care about people, and have a special
talent for bringing out the best in others. ENFJ's main interest in life is giving love, support, and a good
time to other people. They are focused on understanding, supporting, and encouraging others. They make
things happen for people, and get their best personal satisfaction from this.
Because ENFJ's people skills are so extraordinary, they have the ability to make people do exactly what
they want them to do. They get under people's skins and get the reactions that they are seeking. ENFJ's
motives are usually unselfish, but ENFJs who have developed less than ideally have been known to use
their power over people to manipulate them.
ENFJ's are so externally focused that it's especially important for them to spend time alone. This can be
difficult for some ENFJs, because they have the tendency to be hard on themselves and turn to dark
thoughts when alone. Consequently, ENFJs might avoid being alone, and fill their lives with activities
involving other people. ENFJs tend to define their life's direction and priorities according to other people's
needs, and may not be aware of their own needs. It's natural to their personality type that they will tend to
place other people's needs above their own, but they need to stay aware of their own needs so that they
don't sacrifice themselves in their drive to help others.
ENFJ's tend to be more reserved about exposing themselves than other extraverted types. Although they
may have strongly-felt beliefs, they're likely to refrain from expressing them if doing so would interfere
with bringing out the best in others. Because their strongest interest lies in being a catalyst of change in
other people, they're likely to interact with others on their own level, in a chameleon-like manner, rather
than as individuals.
ENFJs have definite values and opinions which they're able to express clearly and succinctly. These beliefs
will be expressed as long as they're not too personal. ENFJ is in many ways expressive and open, but is
more focused on being responsive and supportive of others. When faced with a conflict between a strongly held value and serving another person's need, they are highly likely to value the other person's needs.
The ENFJ may feel quite lonely even when surrounded by people. This feeling of aloneness may be
exacerbated by the tendency to not reveal their true selves.
People love ENFJs. They are fun to be with, and truly understand and love people. They are typically very
straight-forward and honest. Usually ENFJs exude a lot of self-confidence, and have a great amount of
ability to do many different things. They are generally bright, full of potential, energetic and fast-paced.
They are usually good at anything which captures their interest.
ENFJs like for things to be well-organized, and will work hard at maintaining structure and resolving
ambiguity. They have a tendency to be fussy, especially with their home environments.
In the work place, ENFJs do well in positions where they deal with people. They are naturals for the social
committee. Their uncanny ability to understand people and say just what needs to be said to make them
happy makes them naturals for counseling. They enjoy being the center of attention, and do very well in
situations where they can inspire and lead others, such as teaching.
ENFJs do not like dealing with impersonal reasoning. They don't understand or appreciate its merit, and
will be unhappy in situations where they're forced to deal with logic and facts without any connection to a
human element. Living in the world of people possibilities, they enjoy their plans more than their
achievements. They get excited about possibilities for the future, but may become easily bored and restless
with the present.
ENFJs have a special gift with people, and are basically happy people when they can use that gift to help
others. They get their best satisfaction from serving others. Their genuine interest in Humankind and their
exceptional intuitive awareness of people makes them able to draw out even the most reserved individuals.
ENFJs have a strong need for close, intimate relationships, and will put forth a lot of effort in creating and
maintaining these relationships. They're very loyal and trustworthy once involved in a relationship.
An ENFJ who has not developed their Feeling side may have difficulty making good decisions, and may
rely heavily on other people in decision-making processes. If they have not developed their Intuition, they
may not be able to see possibilities, and will judge things too quickly based on established value systems or
social rules, without really understanding the current situation. An ENFJ who has not found their place in
the world is likely to be extremely sensitive to criticism, and to have the tendency to worry excessively and
feel guilty. They are also likely to be very manipulative and controlling with others.
In general, ENFJs are charming, warm, gracious, creative and diverse individuals with richly developed
insights into what makes other people tick. This special ability to see growth potential in others combined
with a genuine drive to help people makes the ENFJ a truly valued individual. As giving and caring as the
ENFJ is, they need to remember to value their own needs as well as the needs of others.`,

their aspirations and their cares forming the world in which an ENFJ lives. They thrive when able to “make
things right” for others, to enable and empower their co-workers, friends and family through valuing their
human strengths and abilities. When gifted with the added ENFJ ability to intuitively adapt their feelings to
the way they are affected by others, the ENFJ has a positive drive to find co-operative pathways leading to
the best possible outcome for all. Success for an ENFJ comes through involvement in the process of
making things happen for people; through the accomplishments and satisfactions of those they have helped
to enrich the human world with greater value, and through finding that their efforts on behalf of others have
fulfilled their own life as well.`,

    potentialProblemAreas: [
      `With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good".
Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our
weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our
personality type's potential problem areas.
Most of the weaker characteristics found in ENFJs are due to their dominant Extraverted Feeling
overvaluing what they see as objective values in the external world and thereby judging too much by the
needs of others, or by appearances. This is primarily due to the ENFJ having not fully adapted their
Introverted Intuitive function sufficiently for them to be able to discern the vast range of ways in which
they might be being missing the underlying needs within themselves and being misled by such
appearances. The ENFJ naturally looks outward to find value and satisfaction, and whilst it is essential that
this direction be taken to fulfill their primary needs of relation and comfort, without the supportive balance
of a well developed Intuitive function, ENFJs can overvalue the external world to the point where they lose
sight of themselves, becoming fixed in their judgments about people and the world. In such cases, the
ENFJ will tend to live in a rigid - and to others, somewhat surreal - world of definite values which often
seems “overstated” or obsessively connected to other people or human situations.`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Most of the problems described above can be seen as a direct result of a too dominant Extraverted Thinking
function ruling the personality. In most cases this is exactly what is happening, but it is also worth
recognizing that some of the weaknesses in the ENTJ’s personality that are more apparent to other Types,
flow not so much from the excesses of the ENTJ’s dominant function, but from the natural inferiority of
their feeling function and its lack of adaptation. We must also recognize that the level of expression of all
functions in all people is variable and that some of the problems discussed here apply only to strongly
expressing ENTJ’s, where the attitude which flows from using Extraverted Thinking exclusively to guide
them through life creates its own particular problems.
The over dominance of Extraverted Thinking leads to an intensely intellectual way of seeing the world,
where values such as right and wrong, good and bad, useful and useless are judged only by their
applicability to an almost mathematically exact - and to the ENTJ - always rational, attitude to life. Without
the balance provided by other ways of seeing or judging, the ENTJ is unable to account for actions based
upon the inner views or feeling behavior of others, hence such things are always judged negatively, either
as irrelevant - or at best - as being of small consequence. Additionally, with their thinking attitude always
turned outward and totally subject to the world beyond their senses, without the balance of some internally
felt objectivity the ENTJ will often follow their ideas and ambitions without consideration for their own
physical and emotional needs. Indeed, the ENTJ often feels that if only his project, his work, his outer
reality would just fall into line with his own rational views then all would be well within his world and all
his needs would be met. Unfortunately such an attitude can never be satisfied, for the world is not only
rational, but also full of situations and human behavior which must be appreciated and understood by quite
different, and again - to the ENTJ – often seemingly absurd criteria.
A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an
ENTJ, dominant Extraverted Thinking needs to be well-supported by their auxiliary Introverted Intuitive
function. If Introverted Intuition exists only to support the intellectual rationale created by Extraverted
Thinking, then neither function is being used to its full potential.
Introverted Intuition is the ENTJ’s access to their inner world, to the information that could tell them how
the world is affecting them. Because it is introverted, its images arise from the subjective depths of the
mind, and contain all that the ENTJ has not considered within their strictly rational and object oriented
view of the world. Introverted Intuition provides the personally biased information the ENTJ needs to
balance this world view and protect the ENTJ from being totally swallowed up by their selfless and yet
single minded attachment to facts, figures and a rationale they accept only from the world outside
themselves. Because this inner information is often opposed to the ENTJ’s strongly held ideas it is often
rejected, or if accepted, turned outward to make negative judgments about external situations or the
behavior of others, rather than seen as a corrective balance to the ENTJ’s own attitudes and behavior`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ENTJ needs to recognize the role Intuition plays in their life, and learn to
understand its language. In particular the ENTJ needs to realize that their intuitive function is not directed
outward to the world, that its images are personal, subjective and relate directly to the way the ENTJ’s
inner self is being affected by both the outside world and their own behavior.
Introverted Intuition is not an obvious process to understand, and quite unlike the rational, straightforward
thinking the ENTJ is used to. Nevertheless, if understood and fully utilized to support thinking, it can make
the ENTJ the most outwardly effective and productive of all the personality types. For this reason it is
essential to allow this gift to become what it can be, rather than limiting its talents and allowing it only to
speak when it seems to agree with the ENTJ’s outwardly focused thinking. Below are a few specific
suggestions to help you apply Introverted Intuition.
When confronted by a situation which requires an important decision, try to put it off for long enough to be
able to sit quietly with it. In doing so allow yourself to feel and see the images which arise in your mind
regarding this situation. Try to set aside those which appear immediately as the products of your own
beliefs and thinking, and regard the others closely. If these images and ideas were the opinions of people
whose judgment you trusted implicitly, try to question them in your mind and find the reasons why they
consider things in such a way.
There are some people around you who always seem to know just which way to go or how things work or
what the outcome of a certain situation will be without them seeming to have sufficient information to be
able to do so. These people are intuitive types and their world is full of possibilities which they can
immediately recognize as apt to certain situations. You also have this talent, but you have a habit of not
following it, rather you prefer to think it out and find the options which “ought” to be correct. I placed
ought in quotes for a very good reason here, for you know yourself how often things have developed in the
direction you had an inkling of, but refused to accept without thinking. Try to let these immediate
impressions have their moment and recognize them as true possibilities which ought to be examined more
closely. Understand that they are not baseless images and ideas but rely upon valid sources of information
which you simply screen out of your life by habit.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ENTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with a
strongly dogmatic and overly rational approach to life, coupled with an almost total lack of ability to
understand the needs of others. Where such a strongly expressing difficulty arises, the ENTJ finds
themselves constantly embattled by a world which refuses to conform to their ideals and creates situations
in which the ENTJ is out of their depth. Such situations are often met by the ENTJ with such a childish
emotionality that others are put off and isolate the ENTJ emotionally. Such ENTJ’s often find themselves
without friends, and with business partners or employees who are unwilling to engage the ENTJ upon any
matter other than strictly task related questions. Such behavior in others only serves to bring out underlying
sentiments in the ENTJ which, via their badly adapted intuitive function, speak to them of plots, nastiness
and covert obstructive behavior on the part of others. Suffice to say, such suspicions and childish
sentiments coupled with dogmatic demands to conform to the ENTJ’s own way of seeing the world can
soon destroy families and close relationships.
It is incumbent upon the ENTJ to break the circle of such behavior by allowing their Introverted Intuition a
place in their life. Through attention to this function the ENTJ can discover a path to understanding and
recognizing the effects not only their own behavior has upon others, but also the greater possibilities which
lie within themselves for not only a harmonious relationship with others, but also a greater sense of what
might be best for themselves.
Understanding the feeling needs and judgments of others is not an easy task for the ENTJ, but through their
Intuitive function they can find images and ideas which - whilst not speaking directly to the feeling
judgments of others – might allow them to see outside the strictly rational circle of their world view in such
a way as to recognize that there is indeed a different perspective which must be taken account of.`,
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Give yourself every opportunity to show others your appreciation of a
situation and how you could see it through to a good outcome. Take charge where you can make it
count.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! Understand you have limits too. Your careful world view is not the whole
deal. How things look and feel may not concern you, but they concern many others. Try and allow
such things to be and learn from them.`,
      `Talk Time to Find Out How Others Really Think. You need to drive past your thoughts with
others and let their appreciations of a situation reach you at a deeper level. It will then be possible
for you to take account of their needs as real world objectives which if included in your ideas will
bring greater harmony and quality to life and relationships.`,
      `Take Time Out To Let The Whole Situation Speak To You. Don't dismiss those abstract and
seemingly hard to understand or bothersome aesthetic and feeling judgments coming from others
or from inside yourself. Drop everything for a while, stop thinking and worrying and just relax
into those ideas and let them speak to you. Perhaps they can be accommodated, perhaps
something is hiding in there which offers a new way`,
      `When You Get Upset, You Lose. Your energy and rational understandings are strong assets, but
can be very harmful if they turn against you and leave you with nothing but emotions you cannot
deal with. Remember that others cannot always be expected to fall into your ways of seeing, and
when your drive to make them do so fails you will suffer feelings of resentment and even
abandonment. You cannot deal with the world like this. Moderate your ideas, allow others their
spaces, and you will grow.`,
      `Respect your need for intellectual compatibility. Don't expect yourself to be a \`touchy-feely\` or
\`warm-fuzzy\` person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with others will start with the head,
rather than the heart. Be aware of other's emotional needs, and express your genuine love and
respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look
inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.`,
      `Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.`,
      `Take a Positive Approach to Differences in People. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling
on what seem to be their limitations. They need you to guide them and you need them to see
things through. Try and recognize who can perform the most ably within certain fields outside
your own competence. Let the feelings of others become a strength rather than a hindrance to you.`,

    type: "ENTJ",
    name: "Extraverted Intuitive Thinking Judging",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Thinking with Introverted Intuition",
    epithet: "The Executive",
    description: `As an ENTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and
logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in primarily via your intuition.
ENTJ's are natural born leaders. They live in a world of possibilities where they see all sorts of challenges
to be surmounted, and they want to be the ones responsible for surmounting them. They have a drive for
leadership, which is well-served by their quickness to grasp complexities, their ability to absorb a large
amount of impersonal information, and their quick and decisive judgments. They are "take charge" people.
ENTJ’s are very career-focused, and fit into the corporate world quite naturally. They are constantly
scanning their environment for potential problems which they can turn into solutions. They generally see
things from a long-range perspective, and are usually successful at identifying plans to turn problems
around - especially problems of a corporate nature. ENTJ’s are usually successful in the business world,
because they are so driven to leadership. They're tireless in their efforts on the job, and driven to visualize
where an organization is headed. For these reasons, they are natural corporate leaders.
There is not much room for error in the world of the ENTJ. They dislike seeing mistakes repeated, and have
no patience with inefficiency. They may become quite harsh when their patience is tried in these respects,
because they are not naturally tuned in to people's feelings, and more than likely don't believe that they
should tailor their judgments in consideration for people's feelings. ENTJ’s, like many types, have
difficulty seeing things from outside their own perspective. Unlike other types, ENTJ’s naturally have little
patience with people who do not see things the same way as the ENTJ. The ENTJ needs to consciously
work on recognizing the value of other people's opinions, as well as the value of being sensitive towards
people's feelings. In the absence of this awareness, the ENTJ will be a forceful, intimidating and
overbearing individual. This may be a real problem for the ENTJ, who may be deprived of important
information and collaboration from others. In their personal world, it can make some ENTJ’s overbearing
as spouses or parents.
The ENTJ has a tremendous amount of personal power and presence which will work for them as a force
towards achieving their goals. However, this personal power is also an agent of alienation and self aggrandizement, which the ENTJ would do well to avoid.
ENTJ’s are very forceful, decisive individuals. They make decisions quickly, and are quick to verbalize
their opinions and decisions to the rest of the world. The ENTJ who has not developed their Intuition will
make decisions too hastily, without understanding all of the issues and possible solutions. On the other
hand, an ENTJ who has not developed their Thinking side will have difficulty applying logic to their
insights, and will often make poor decisions. In that case, they may have brilliant ideas and insight into
situations, but they may have little skill at determining how to act upon their understanding, or their actions
may be inconsistent. An ENTJ who has developed in a generally less than ideal way may become
dictatorial and abrasive - intrusively giving orders and direction without a sound reason for doing so, and
without consideration for the people involved.
Although ENTJ’s are not naturally tuned into other people's feelings, these individuals frequently have very
strong sentimental streaks. Often these sentiments are very powerful to the ENTJ, although they will likely
hide it from general knowledge, believing the feelings to be a weakness. Because the world of feelings and
values is not where the ENTJ naturally functions, they may sometimes make value judgments and hold
onto submerged emotions which are ill-founded and inappropriate, and will cause them problems -
sometimes rather serious problems.
ENTJ’s love to interact with people. As Extroverts, they're energized and stimulated primarily externally.
There's nothing more enjoyable and satisfying to the ENTJ than having a lively, challenging conversation.
They especially respect people who are able to stand up to the ENTJ, and argue persuasively for their point
of view. There aren't too many people who will do so, however, because the ENTJ is a very forceful and
dynamic presence who has a tremendous amount of self-confidence and excellent verbal communication
skills. Even the most confident individuals may experience moments of self-doubt when debating a point
with an ENTJ.
ENTJ’s want their home to be beautiful, well-furnished, and efficiently run. They're likely to place much
emphasis on their children being well-educated and structured, to desire a congenial and devoted
relationship with their spouse. At home, the ENTJ needs to be in charge as much as he or she does in their
career. The ENTJ is likely best paired with someone who has a strong self-image, who is also a Thinking
type. Because the ENTJ is primarily focused on their careers, some ENTJ’s have a problem with being
constantly absent from home, physically or mentally.
The ENTJ has many gifts which make it possible for them to have a great deal of personal power, if they
don't forget to remain balanced in their lives. They are assertive, innovative, long-range thinkers with an
excellent ability to translate theories and possibilities into solid plans of action. They are usually
tremendously forceful personalities, and have the tools to accomplish whatever goals they set out for.`,

    successDefinition: `ENTJ people are realists, in the most basic sense of the word. Not only because their thinking is based upon
a clear view of how things actually are in the world around them, but also because their ideas and strategies
are structured around those unambiguous, “down to earth”, commonsense beliefs which sum up the
obvious and undeniable in life. But while ENTJ’s might be pragmatic about the immediate situation before
them, they are scarcely satisfied with it until it can be made more productive, useful or valuable. The
ENTJ’s reasoning on such matters is always clear and generally unemotional. If action can improve an item
or a situation then it ought to be taken, and the ENTJ will always be found in the midst of such action,
organizing, planning and leading the way forward until the best result possible has been realized. This
makes success for an ENTJ something that can be clearly seen, a real world result which can be measured.
And whether measured in dollars, bricks, bread or just happy people, the successful ENTJ knows the result
is due to their belief that it is just plain commonsense to try and make the best of every situation and get the
most out if it for the most people.`,

    explanationOfProblems: `Most of the problems described above can be seen as a direct result of a too dominant Extraverted Thinking
function ruling the personality. In most cases this is exactly what is happening, but it is also worth
recognizing that some of the weaknesses in the ENTJ’s personality that are more apparent to other Types,
flow not so much from the excesses of the ENTJ’s dominant function, but from the natural inferiority of
their feeling function and its lack of adaptation. We must also recognize that the level of expression of all
functions in all people is variable and that some of the problems discussed here apply only to strongly
expressing ENTJ’s, where the attitude which flows from using Extraverted Thinking exclusively to guide
them through life creates its own particular problems.
The over dominance of Extraverted Thinking leads to an intensely intellectual way of seeing the world,
where values such as right and wrong, good and bad, useful and useless are judged only by their
applicability to an almost mathematically exact - and to the ENTJ - always rational, attitude to life. Without
the balance provided by other ways of seeing or judging, the ENTJ is unable to account for actions based
upon the inner views or feeling behavior of others, hence such things are always judged negatively, either
as irrelevant - or at best - as being of small consequence. Additionally, with their thinking attitude always
turned outward and totally subject to the world beyond their senses, without the balance of some internally
felt objectivity the ENTJ will often follow their ideas and ambitions without consideration for their own
physical and emotional needs. Indeed, the ENTJ often feels that if only his project, his work, his outer
reality would just fall into line with his own rational views then all would be well within his world and all
his needs would be met. Unfortunately such an attitude can never be satisfied, for the world is not only
rational, but also full of situations and human behavior which must be appreciated and understood by quite
different, and again - to the ENTJ – often seemingly absurd criteria.
A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an
ENTJ, dominant Extraverted Thinking needs to be well-supported by their auxiliary Introverted Intuitive
function. If Introverted Intuition exists only to support the intellectual rationale created by Extraverted
Thinking, then neither function is being used to its full potential.
Introverted Intuition is the ENTJ’s access to their inner world, to the information that could tell them how
the world is affecting them. Because it is introverted, its images arise from the subjective depths of the
mind, and contain all that the ENTJ has not considered within their strictly rational and object oriented
view of the world. Introverted Intuition provides the personally biased information the ENTJ needs to
balance this world view and protect the ENTJ from being totally swallowed up by their selfless and yet
single minded attachment to facts, figures and a rationale they accept only from the world outside
themselves. Because this inner information is often opposed to the ENTJ’s strongly held ideas it is often
rejected, or if accepted, turned outward to make negative judgments about external situations or the
behavior of others, rather than seen as a corrective balance to the ENTJ’s own attitudes and behavior.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ENTJ needs to recognize the role Intuition plays in their life, and learn to
understand its language. In particular the ENTJ needs to realize that their intuitive function is not directed
outward to the world, that its images are personal, subjective and relate directly to the way the ENTJ’s
inner self is being affected by both the outside world and their own behavior.
Introverted Intuition is not an obvious process to understand, and quite unlike the rational, straightforward
thinking the ENTJ is used to. Nevertheless, if understood and fully utilized to support thinking, it can make
the ENTJ the most outwardly effective and productive of all the personality types. For this reason it is
essential to allow this gift to become what it can be, rather than limiting its talents and allowing it only to
speak when it seems to agree with the ENTJ’s outwardly focused thinking. Below are a few specific
suggestions to help you apply Introverted Intuition.
When confronted by a situation which requires an important decision, try to put it off for long enough to be
able to sit quietly with it. In doing so allow yourself to feel and see the images which arise in your mind
regarding this situation. Try to set aside those which appear immediately as the products of your own
beliefs and thinking, and regard the others closely. If these images and ideas were the opinions of people
whose judgment you trusted implicitly, try to question them in your mind and find the reasons why they
consider things in such a way.
There are some people around you who always seem to know just which way to go or how things work or
what the outcome of a certain situation will be without them seeming to have sufficient information to be
able to do so. These people are intuitive types and their world is full of possibilities which they can
immediately recognize as apt to certain situations. You also have this talent, but you have a habit of not
following it, rather you prefer to think it out and find the options which “ought” to be correct. I placed
ought in quotes for a very good reason here, for you know yourself how often things have developed in the
direction you had an inkling of, but refused to accept without thinking. Try to let these immediate
impressions have their moment and recognize them as true possibilities which ought to be examined more
closely. Understand that they are not baseless images and ideas but rely upon valid sources of information
which you simply screen out of your life by habit.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ENTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with a
strongly dogmatic and overly rational approach to life, coupled with an almost total lack of ability to
understand the needs of others. Where such a strongly expressing difficulty arises, the ENTJ finds
themselves constantly embattled by a world which refuses to conform to their ideals and creates situations
in which the ENTJ is out of their depth. Such situations are often met by the ENTJ with such a childish
emotionality that others are put off and isolate the ENTJ emotionally. Such ENTJ’s often find themselves
without friends, and with business partners or employees who are unwilling to engage the ENTJ upon any
matter other than strictly task related questions. Such behavior in others only serves to bring out underlying
sentiments in the ENTJ which, via their badly adapted intuitive function, speak to them of plots, nastiness
and covert obstructive behavior on the part of others. Suffice to say, such suspicions and childish
sentiments coupled with dogmatic demands to conform to the ENTJ’s own way of seeing the world can
soon destroy families and close relationships.
It is incumbent upon the ENTJ to break the circle of such behavior by allowing their Introverted Intuition a
place in their life. Through attention to this function the ENTJ can discover a path to understanding and
recognizing the effects not only their own behavior has upon others, but also the greater possibilities which
lie within themselves for not only a harmonious relationship with others, but also a greater sense of what
might be best for themselves.
Understanding the feeling needs and judgments of others is not an easy task for the ENTJ, but through their
Intuitive function they can find images and ideas which - whilst not speaking directly to the feeling
judgments of others – might allow them to see outside the strictly rational circle of their world view in such
a way as to recognize that there is indeed a different perspective which must be taken account of.`,
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Give yourself every opportunity to show others your appreciation of a
situation and how you could see it through to a good outcome. Take charge where you can make it
count.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! Understand you have limits too. Your careful world view is not the whole
deal. How things look and feel may not concern you, but they concern many others. Try and allow
such things to be and learn from them.`,
      `Talk Time to Find Out How Others Really Think. You need to drive past your thoughts with
others and let their appreciations of a situation reach you at a deeper level. It will then be possible
for you to take account of their needs as real world objectives which if included in your ideas will
bring greater harmony and quality to life and relationships.`,
      `Take Time Out To Let The Whole Situation Speak To You. Don't dismiss those abstract and
seemingly hard to understand or bothersome aesthetic and feeling judgments coming from others
or from inside yourself. Drop everything for a while, stop thinking and worrying and just relax
into those ideas and let them speak to you. Perhaps they can be accommodated, perhaps
something is hiding in there which offers a new way`,
      `When You Get Upset, You Lose. Your energy and rational understandings are strong assets, but
can be very harmful if they turn against you and leave you with nothing but emotions you cannot
deal with. Remember that others cannot always be expected to fall into your ways of seeing, and
when your drive to make them do so fails you will suffer feelings of resentment and even
abandonment. You cannot deal with the world like this. Moderate your ideas, allow others their
spaces, and you will grow.`,
      `Respect your need for intellectual compatibility. Don't expect yourself to be a \`touchy-feely\` or
\`warm-fuzzy\` person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with others will start with the head,
rather than the heart. Be aware of other's emotional needs, and express your genuine love and
respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look
inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.`,
      `Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.`,
      `Take a Positive Approach to Differences in People. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling
on what seem to be their limitations. They need you to guide them and you need them to see
things through. Try and recognize who can perform the most ably within certain fields outside
your own competence. Let the feelings of others become a strength rather than a hindrance to you.`,
      `Don't Get Obsessed! Recognize the value that personal world has to you, your friends, your
family, your own inner sense of self worth and life. Take pride in just being a good person and
don’t allow external situations to control you. Try to relax and let the moment belong to the best
things you can find in others and yourself. Nothing out there is more important than your own
happiness`,

    type: "ENFP",
    name: "Extraverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Intuition with Introverted Feeling",
    epithet: "The Inspirer",
    description: `As an ENFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via
your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you feel
about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system.
ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of
possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm lends them the
ability to inspire and motivate others, more so than we see in other types. They can talk their way in or out
of anything. They love life, seeing it as a special gift, and strive to make the most out of it.
ENFPs have an unusually broad range of skills and talents. They are good at most things which interest
them. Project-oriented, they may go through several different careers during their lifetime. To onlookers,
the ENFP may seem directionless and without purpose, but ENFPs are actually quite consistent, in that they
have a strong sense of values which they live with throughout their lives. Everything that they do must be
in line with their values. An ENFP needs to feel that they are living their lives as their true Self, walking in
step with what they believe is right. They see meaning in everything, and are on a continuous quest to adapt
their lives and values to achieve inner peace. They're constantly aware and somewhat fearful of losing
touch with themselves. Since emotional excitement is usually an important part of the ENFP's life, and
because they are focused on keeping "centered", the ENFP is usually an intense individual, with highly
evolved values.
An ENFP needs to focus on following through with their projects. This can be a problem area for some of
these individuals. Unlike other Extraverted types, ENFPs need time alone to center themselves, and make
sure they are moving in a direction which is in sync with their values. ENFPs who remain centered will
usually be quite successful at their endeavors. Others may fall into the habit of dropping a project when
they become excited about a new possibility, and thus they never achieve the great accomplishments which
they are capable of achieving.
Most ENFPs have great people skills. They are genuinely warm and interested in people, and place great
importance on their inter-personal relationships. ENFPs almost always have a strong need to be liked.
Sometimes, especially at a younger age, an ENFP will tend to be "gushy" and insincere, and generally
"overdo" in an effort to win acceptance. However, once an ENFP has learned to balance their need to be
true to themselves with their need for acceptance, they excel at bringing out the best in others, and are
typically well-liked. They have an exceptional ability to intuitively understand a person after a very short
period of time, and use their intuition and flexibility to relate to others on their own level.
Because ENFPs live in the world of exciting possibilities, the details of everyday life are seen as trivial
drudgery. They place no importance on detailed, maintenance-type tasks, and will frequently remain
oblivious to these types of concerns. When they do have to perform these tasks, they do not enjoy
themselves. This is a challenging area of life for most ENFPs, and can be frustrating for ENFP's family
members.
An ENFP who has "gone wrong" may be quite manipulative - and very good it. The gift of gab which they
are blessed with makes it naturally easy for them to get what they want. Most ENFPs will not abuse their
abilities, because that would not jive with their value systems.
ENFPs sometimes make serious errors in judgment. They have an amazing ability to intuitively perceive
the truth about a person or situation, but when they apply judgment to their perception, they may jump to
the wrong conclusions.
ENFPs who have not learned to follow through may have a difficult time remaining happy in marital
relationships. Always seeing the possibilities of what could be, they may become bored with what actually
is. The strong sense of values will keep many ENFPs dedicated to their relationships. However, ENFPs like
a little excitement in their lives, and are best matched with individuals who are comfortable with change
and new experiences.
Having an ENFP parent can be a fun-filled experience, but may be stressful at times for children with
strong Sensing or Judging tendencies. Such children may see the ENFP parent as inconsistent and difficult
to understand, as the children are pulled along in the whirlwind life of the ENFP. Sometimes the ENFP will
want to be their child's best friend, and at other times they will play the parental authoritarian. But ENFPs
are always consistent in their value systems, which they will impress on their children above all else, along
with a basic joy of living.
ENFPs are basically happy people. They may become unhappy when they are confined to strict schedules
or mundane tasks. Consequently, ENFPs work best in situations where they have a lot of flexibility, and
where they can work with people and ideas. Many go into business for themselves. They have the ability to
be quite productive with little supervision, as long as they are excited about what they're doing.
Because they are so alert and sensitive, constantly scanning their environments, ENFPs often suffer from
muscle tension. They have a strong need to be independent, and resist being controlled or labeled. They
need to maintain control over themselves, but they do not believe in controlling others. Their dislike of
dependence and suppression extends to others as well as to themselves.
ENFPs are charming, ingenuous, risk-taking, sensitive, people-oriented individuals with capabilities
ranging across a broad spectrum. They have many gifts which they will use to fulfill themselves and those
near them, if they are able to remain centered and master the ability of following through.`,

    successDefinition: `ENFPs are motivated in everything that they do by a desire to understand the world around them. They are
constantly searching about. Mentally and physically, for input that will help them to better understand the
Big Picture. They are open-minded to new people and new experiences; they’re eager for the opportunity
to understand what the new people and experiences are all about. ENFPs use their understanding of the
world to serve the agendas of their value systems. An ENFP’s value system often includes respect for the
needs and desires of individual people over the needs of a social group. Their respect for the individual
makes them dislike controlling others, and being controlled by others. ENFPs are passionate about their
beliefs, whatever they may be. They often stubbornly adhere to their value system regardless of threats to
its validity. They are more concerned with keeping true to what they believe than they are with
expectations or demands from the social group that they function within. ENFPs dislike personal criticism,
because it threatens their validity as an individual and the validity of their value system. ENFPs may
internalize anger rather than express it; their respect for other individuals makes it difficult for them to hurt
others. An ENFP’s feeling of success depends upon the availability of opportunities to grow their
understanding of the world, upon feeling that they’re living true to their personal value system, and upon
the condition of their closest relationships.`,
    strengths: [
      `They’re exceptionally perceptive about people and situations. They’re often able to quickly and
accurately assess where someone is coming from.`,
      `They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They believe that
individuals have the right to be themselves, and are very tolerant and accepting of most people.`,
      `They’re often deep and intelligent, and may be quite brilliant in their ability to tie things together.
They’re wired to look for connections in the external world, and so they may mentally put things
together more easily than others.`,
      `Their interest in understanding the world usually makes them in tune with what’s socially
acceptable and what isn’t. This may help them to be popular and likeable.`,
      `They’re highly creative. This ability may be used in an artistic way, or may be used to generate
ideas and new ways of thinking.`,

    gifts: [
      `They will have the ability to follow through on projects they’ve begun.`,
      `They will be less gullible and malleable, and generally more able to discern between “good” and
“bad”, rather than accepting everything without question.`,
      `They may be highly artistic.`,
      `They will have the ability to focus and concentrate deeply on tasks. This enhanced ability to think
and process information internally will make them more capable on many levels.`,
      `They will balance out their desire to meet new people and have new experiences with the desire to

      `May feel intense anger towards people who criticize them or try to control them. But will be
unable to express the anger. Left unexpressed, the anger may fester and simmer and become
destructive.`,

      `May be unable to stick to a career or job for any length of time.`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ENFP problem of wanting to understand and experience everything at any cost. If the ENFP does
not learn how to discriminate things and people in their external environment, the ENFP will begin to use
their judging function (Introverted Feeling) as solve a “rubber stamper” to support their agenda to seek out
experiences. This is a natural survivalist technique for the ENFP personality. The main driver to the ENFP
personality is Extraverted Intuition, whose purpose is to understand the world as one Big Picture, seeking
connections and meaning in everything. If their ability to seek understanding is threatened, the ENFP shuts
out the threatening force. This is totally natural, but unfortunately the individual who exercises this type of
agenda protection regularly will become more and more unable to apply judgment to anything. When the
unbalanced ENFP does apply judgment, it will generally be skewed to support their subjective agenda.
They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behavior. They will be unable to finish
anything that they start, and generally wander through life from experience to experience.
It’s very common for ENFPs to resist applying judgment until they feel they truly understand a person or
situation. However, part of the understanding process includes using discernment to classify qualities. If
the ENFP shuts judgment off entirely, he or she will not achieve their ultimate goal of understanding; rather
they will jump from experience to experience in a purposeless fashion.
Anger can be a problem for anybody, but may be especially so for ENFPs who have not sufficiently
developed their Introverted Feeling. The desire to keep everything non-judgmental, combined with the
tendency to use Introverted Feeling as justification rather than true judgment is a recipe for suppressed
anger. These are very contradictory forces. “I hate you for judging me” is an ironic feeling, but is
unfortunately common. The inability to apply judgment or to accept negative judgment prevents the ENFP
from expressing negative judgment, and therefore causes them to stew in their anger, rather than deal with
it`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ENFP needs to focus on applying judgment to all of their perceptions. This
means they need to decide how they really feel about people, places and things, rather than allowing their
feelings to hang open indeterminately. The ENFP needs to understand that developing their ability to
discern qualities does not threaten their ability to understand the world, but rather enhances it, and enhances
their personal changes for achieving a measure of success in their lives.
The ENFP concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for making a
judgment. Are they trying to really determine the objective value or merit of something, or are they trying
to defend their individual right to not be judged or controlled? The goal when judging something is to not
let your personal agenda influence your opinions. Obviously, this is not entirely possible, but it is the
exercise to keep in mind. You want to open your mind to judgment without feeling threatened, and without
using your own judgment in a defensive, rationalizing mode.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `As can be seen from the above, some ENFPs can have difficulty fitting into society. Their problems are
often due top feeling different from others because of their dominant Intuition, and being unable to stick to
anything long enough to feel a sense of accomplishment. They feel like they don’t fit in, and can’t find the
place where they belong in the world. The ENFP who consistently makes decisions and applies
classifications to their ideas will be able to turn their ideas into reality, and experience the feelings of
accomplishment and success that accompany being effective.
The key to personal growth for the ENFP is competent execution of Introverted Feeling. It’s difficult for
most to understand what this means, much less incorporate that directive into your life. I have created
some action-oriented suggestions that will help lead you down the path towards more effective use of the
Introverted Feeling function. Specific suggestions:
When you feel angry or resistant towards someone who you feel is criticizing you, take this as a cue that
you are not judging effectively. When that happens, take a step back from your anger and try to really hear
what the person is saying objectively. Rather than expending mental energy in defining how the other
person is wrong, try to judge what the person is actually saying.
Periodically make lists of goals and accomplishments. Revisit your goals and accomplishments as often as
you’d like to maintain a sense of direction.
Spend time alone regularly for the purpose of thinking through issues in your life.

    type: "ENTP",
    name: "Extraverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Intuition with Introverted Thinking",
    epithet: "The Visionary",
    description: `As an ENTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in primarily via
your intuition. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally and logically.
With Extraverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's primary interest in life is
understanding the world that they live in. They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the
situations they are presented in their lives. Using their intuition to process this information, they are usually
extremely quick and accurate in their ability to size up a situation. With the exception of their ENFP
cousin, the ENTP has a deeper understanding of their environment than any of the other types.
This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts the ENTP at a distinct advantage in their
lives. They generally understand things quickly and with great depth. Accordingly, they are quite flexible
and adapt well to a wide range of tasks. They are good at most anything that interests them. As they grow
and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they become very aware of possibilities, and this
makes them quite resourceful when solving problems.
ENTP's are idea people. Their perceptive abilities cause them to see possibilities everywhere. They get
excited and enthusiastic about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to others. In this way,
they get the support that they need to fulfill their visions.
ENTP’s are less interested in developing plans of actions or making decisions than they are in generating
possibilities and ideas. Following through on the implementation of an idea is usually a chore to the ENTP.
For some ENTP’s, this results in the habit of never finishing what they start. The ENTP who has not
developed their Thinking process will have problems with jumping enthusiastically from idea to idea,
without following through on their plans. The ENTP needs to take care to think through their ideas fully in
order to take advantage of them.
The ENTP's auxiliary process of Introverted Thinking drives their decision making process. Although the
ENTP is more interested in absorbing information than in making decisions, they are quite rational and
logical in reaching conclusions. When they apply Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the outcome can
be very powerful indeed. A well-developed ENTP is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising.
ENTP’s are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal sparring with others. They love to
debate issues, and may even switch sides sometimes just for the love of the debate. When they express their
underlying principles, however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely.
The ENTP personality type is sometimes referred to the "Lawyer" type. The ENTP "lawyer" quickly and
accurately understands a situation, and objectively and logically acts upon the situation. Their Thinking
side makes their actions and decisions based on an objective list of rules or laws. If the ENTP was
defending someone who had actually committed a crime, they are likely to take advantage of quirks in the
law that will get their client off the hook. If they were to actually win the case, they would see their actions
as completely fair and proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful. The guilt or innocence of
their client would not be as relevant. If this type of reasoning goes incompletely unchecked by the ENTP, it
could result in a character that is perceived by others as unethical or even dishonest. The ENTP, who does
not naturally consider the more personal or human element in decision making, should take care to notice
the subjective, personal side of situations. This is a potential problem are for ENTP’s. Although their
logical abilities lend strength and purpose to the ENTP, they may also isolate them from their feelings and
from other people.
The least developed area for the ENTP is the Sensing-Feeling arena. If the Sensing areas are neglected, the
ENTP may tend to not take care of details in their life. If their Feeling part is neglected, the ENTP may not
value other people's input enough, or may become overly harsh and aggressive.
Under stress, the ENTP may lose their ability to generate possibilities, and become obsessed with minor
details. These details may seem to be extremely important to the ENTP, but in reality are usually not
important to the big picture.
In general, ENTP’s are upbeat visionaries. They highly value knowledge, and spend much of their lives
seeking a higher understanding. They live in the world of possibilities, and become excited about concepts,
challenges and difficulties. When presented with a problem, they're good at improvising and quickly come
up with a creative solution. Creative, clever, curious, and theoretical, ENTP’s have a broad range of
possibilities in their lives.`,

    successDefinition: `ENTP personalities are motivated by possibilities. They love the outside chances; the new or unusual
combinations lurking within the ordinary everyday world of things and ideas. For them, something is
always on the up, something is always tantalizing their desire to re-orchestrate life into new patterns and
shapes; new ways of fulfilling what can be as strong as a never ending desire to beat the odds and win at
every game in town, or as mild as a quirky personal need for constant variety and change. With their
thinking tied to the myriad possibilities they see in the world, they act swiftly and decisively upon those
angles, choices and combinations scarcely noticed by other types, but through which they can build whole
new frameworks or completely redefine an existing external situation in such a way that it appears new,
revitalized and once again full of promise. Sameness, stasis, conservatism - even daily routine - can be
loathsome to fervent ENTP’s, whose drive is always to be into something new, different and full of fresh
possibilities, and who, given the opportunity, will always be the first to show others a new path to success
in a venture, or to find a way of doing something that no-one has done before.
ENTP people measure their success by their “aha” moments, by the sense of satisfaction which comes as
they spread their newly written maps before them and contemplate the new adventure, design, investigation
or conquest which has now become their road ahead. What has gone before, previous achievements, ways
of living - even people met along the way - are often now forgotten or considered passé, mere steps along a
path which has now brought a new frontier to be exploited for its gifts. Whether it is the search for
knowledge, money, power, fame or pleasure, the ENTP will be found at the frontline, gazing into the
distance and discovering new avenues toward, bigger, better or more satisfying outcomes.
ENTP’s are the great problem solvers, discoverers and re-inventors of the world. Their insights into the
world around them, their ability to see new ways of putting things together and making them work can
bring them great success in virtually any industry or human pursuit that interests them. For this reason the
ENTP is happiest in situations where they can use their intuitive powers freely and have the space in which
to think upon the aspects and angles which come to them. Without fulfilling work and the freedom to use
their mind most productively, ENTP’s can quickly tire of a limiting situation. For this reason an open road
toward success is an extremely important factor in the ENTP’s life. Some, given a little opportunity, will
clear one for themselves, but of all the types, it is the ENTP who has most need to be aware of the life and
career situations they might commit to without sufficient thought for the future.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ENTP problem of being so fascinated with their Extroverted Intuitions that they fail to develop a
careful thinking process sufficient to balance it. Leaps of perception, new ideas and strange but fascinating
juxtapositions are wonderful for the potential freshness and possible success they might bring. But if not
carefully appraised and chosen wisely they can also take us far from the right path in life, take us from our
friends, spoil our relationships and even bring personal or financial disaster. Without a well developed
thinking function, the ENTP is always in danger of leaping over social, financial and personal constraints
for the sake of following a new vision. This might be as simple as arousing the wrath of ones partner by
suddenly deciding to by an expensive gadget or change something around the house without being
concerned for their input or feelings, or as complex as allowing an ill considered entrepreneurial idea lead
them into financial and social disaster, simply because the one sided vision of Extroverted Intuition does
not recognize or count the amount of small but important details which need to be right before such ideas
can be realized.
Without a solid thinking function, the ENTP can easily discount or fail to notice the essential ethics of
social and interpersonal relationship, often considering themselves “above” or untouched by such limiting
values and often discounting the possibility that their actions might be or hurtful or seen as unethical by
others. It is not that the one sided ENTP is deliberately hurtful, but simply ignorant of the effects which can
flow from their often compulsive need for change or need to show how clever or individual they are. In the
ENTP, the lack of a well developed Feeling Function means that they must learn to “understand” feeling in
both themselves and others and come to terms with its affects. This understanding can only come from
thinking carefully about the ways feeling affects not only themselves, but others, and the importance others
place on this function. The ENTP has a feeling function more or less global in character and one which
does not judge fine differences. This inability to discriminate feelings can allow the ENTP to say and do
much that leaves others in the cold, so an effort to think about the feeling process can be essential. Without
the understanding this brings, the ENTP can separate themselves from the ground of their life, from the
constancy of their friends and family and, without even realizing it, they can easily find themselves in
untenable positions where, without support, they wonder why they are suddenly alone and lost.
Another significant problem arises where the ENTP has grown within or is locked by circumstances to an
environment which limits their freedom or their ability to utilize their specific abilities. This forces the
ENTP to narrow down their intuitive process to the point where it retains at least some freedom to operate
within their life. Under such conditions however, the intuition is free only to range over a small and limited
field of vision, a field which usually consists only of the very things the ENTP is normally unconcerned
about: the small details of life and its familiar objects. Without the ability to take stock and apply careful
thought to the ways they might expand their horizons, the ENTP in such situations can become morose,
niggardly and obsessed with the most minor or intangible details – to the point where such minutiae fill
their life and each day becomes a frustrating process of eliminating again and again the little problems
which ever seem to stand in the way of the “big” picture – a picture which, as those around them know only
too well, will never be realized.`,
    solutions: "",
    livingHappilyTips: `To grow as an individual, the ENTP needs to focus on carefully analyzing the information they receive via
their Extraverted Intuition. They need to allow themselves sufficient time and space to relax with the ideas
and possibilities they can see. It is all too easy for the ENTP to assume that what they see is what they
need. Careful thinking can allow the ENTP to figure out the best possible ways to proceed out of all the
possibilities that come to them. At the same time, even if they are not able to share them, ENTP’s need at
least to understand the joys and satisfactions that others derive within those situations the ENTP would not
normally choose in life. Awareness of the ways and needs of others can be the key to understanding the
most life affirming way ahead for the ENTP, for there is always a danger that they might choose paths
without regard to the feelings and needs of others close to them. The ENTP learns from analyzing his
experience, so the best way for the ENTP to grow as a person is to develop his thinking capacity. Thus, that
while the desire to run out and do something "new" is an ENTP pattern of need, this need must be
integrated into a whole way of life in which the rest of our human needs and those of others who rely upon
our presence are also satisfied. Your task, as a person interested in personal growth, is to understand
yourself in a truly objective fashion, and how you can best give to the world, rather than just exploit the
possibilities it bring to you.
The ENTP should always pay close attention to why they are acting upon new information. Are they acting
out of a carefully considered motive to realize something truly worthwhile for themselves and others? Are
they really seeking to improve life, or concerned with just making the next play, proving the point, showing
others the moves or climbing the mountain just because it is there to climb, regardless of the consequences?
Living Happily in our World as an ENTP
The problems ENTP’s might have fitting into the world are not usually directly related to friends or
relationships. Rather, the ENTP has trouble maintaining a stable and consistent lifestyle. While this can
affect love relationships, the ENTP usually has such an endearing and capable “way” about them that
others tend to follow their lead, even in the most trying of situations. The problems the ENTP generates in
life are those associated with their constant need for individuality, excellence and new experiences which
test their talents. While this can place great demand upon relationships, tensions are usually only apparent
where the ENTP has made a love match with a person whose security needs are greater than their ability to
allow their ENTP partner the freedom they need. The self aware ENTP must therefore not only be careful
in considering their career choices, but also in choosing a life situation with a partner. Of all the types, the
ENTP is most uncomfortable with compromise and ought not to place themselves in situations which
demand it. Most importantly the ENTP must become aware, through careful analysis of experience, just
what kind of changes for the good or bad have been the direct result of their need for constant refreshment
of life. Only through this awareness will the ENTP be able to focus on those perceptions which promise a
better and more fruitful life.
Most ENTP’s will experience career/life frustration and some relationship difficulties through their lives.
The ENTP with well-developed Introverted Thinking will find these times easier to deal with. Accordingly,
we offer some general suggestions for dealing with these difficulties, as well as some advice that will help
the ENTP develop their Introverted Thinking.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take time to really listen to the thoughts of others and try to see how they understand the world. Think
about the ways in which your view of the world and your needs can mesh with theirs.
Don't expect others to simply follow you or expect that they should see what you can see as a worthy goal.
A good exercise is to imagine yourself as a blind or severely disabled person. Try to get the feel of what it
would be like to have to organize your life from such a different perspective. Would your goals still be
valid? Would they need re-thinking? Consider the possibility that while your way of thinking leads you to
see other types as having limited vision or ability, the truth is that they are no more limited than yourself,
but simply have a differing focus in life and differing needs.
Realize and accept that for you a satisfying relationship will require you to attend to the small details of life
and show an awareness of your partner’s feelings. You might find this difficult, but it will pay the biggest
dividends in return for your effort.
Expanding your appreciation of the differences between people will expand your understanding of human
expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and encounter in your life.
Take care to listen to what people express within different social and work situations. Notice the different
ways they go about their dealings with others or solving their problems. Do not try to compare or judge
their ways against your own, simply try to recognize the many ways it is possible to be at peace in the
world.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, spend at least half of the time talking about them.
Concentrate on really understanding where the person is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. Remember that they have their own passions, satisfactions and
needs. Try to visualize what that person is doing, and narrow down to how they are feeling at this moment;
to one thing they might be thinking about. Don't pass judgment, just consider and reflect on why they might
think or feel in just such a way.`,

    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Realize your gift of seeing past the obvious brings you a great capacity to
reward yourself and others through your cleverness. Make sure you engage in activities and which
can expose this potential at its most valuable level.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! We all have weaknesses. Recognizing your weaknesses for what they are
(without beating yourself up) will give you the power to change your life for the better.`,
      `Talk Through Your Perceptions. Discussing what you see with others will them understand where
you are coming from, and offer you the chance to discover the ways in which their input can
balance your ideas.`,
      `Relax and Enjoy the View. Take the time to consider what you have, the gifts life has already
brought to you. Try and discover the value and importance of those constant day to day things
which support and nourish you.`,
      `Be Aware of Others Understand that everyone has their own lives and their own perspectives.
Everyone has something to offer. Try to identify people's personality type.`,
      `Recognize Norms and Structures Are Necessary. Remember that without the support and
constancy of others, no-one can follow their dreams. The path you walk was laid by others, each
of its stepping stones created to fulfill a different part of the human need for constancy and
security. Without this support structure, you cannot go far.`,
      `Get Out of Your Comfort Zone Understand that the only way to grow is to get outside of your
comfort zone. If you're feeling uncomfortable in situation because it seems to be going nowhere,
that's good! That's an opportunity for growth.`,
      `Identify and Express Your Feelings You may have a hard time understanding your feelings. It's
important that you try to figure this out. Don't let people down. If you determine that you value a
person, tell them so every time you think of it. This is the best way to make them feel secure in
your affections, and so to promote a long-lasting relationship.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself Remember that no one has more control over your life than you
have. Don't be a victim.`,
      `Assume the Best, But Be Wary. Your positive attitude nearly always creates positive situations.
Just remember: to make them lasting and worthwhile you must build them on solid, carefully
planned foundations`,

    type: "ESFJ",
    name: "Extraverted Sensing Feeling Judging",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Feeling with Introverted Sensing",
    epithet: "The Caregiver",
    description: `As an ESFJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things according to
how you feel about them, or how they fit in with your personal value system. Your secondary mode is
internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.
ESFJ's are people persons - they love people. They are warmly interested in others. They use their Sensing
and Judging characteristics to gather specific, detailed information about others, and turn this information
into supportive judgments. They want to like people, and have a special skill at bringing out the best in
others. They are extremely good at reading others, and understanding their point of view. The ESFJ's strong
desire to be liked and for everything to be pleasant makes them highly supportive of others. People like to
be around ESFJ’s, because the ESFJ has a special gift of invariably making people feel good about
themselves.
The ESFJ takes their responsibilities very seriously, and is very dependable. They value security and
stability, and have a strong focus on the details of life. They see before others do what needs to be done,
and do whatever it takes to make sure that it gets done. They enjoy these types of tasks, and are extremely
good at them.
ESFJ’s are warm and energetic. They need approval from others to feel good about themselves. They are
hurt by indifference and don't understand unkindness. They are very giving people, who get a lot of their
personal satisfaction from the happiness of others. They want to be appreciated for who they are, and what
they give. They're very sensitive to others, and freely give practical care. ESFJ’s are such caring individuals
that they sometimes have a hard time seeing or accepting a difficult truth about someone they care about.
With Extraverted Feeling dominating their personality, ESFJ’s are focused on reading other people. They
have a strong need to be liked, and to be in control. They are extremely good at reading others, and often
change their own manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're with at the moment.
The ESFJ's value system is defined externally. They usually have very well-formed ideas about the way
things should be, and are not shy about expressing these opinions. However, they weigh their values and
morals against the world around them, rather than against an internal value system. They may have a strong
moral code, but it is defined by the community that they live in, rather than by any strongly felt internal
values.
ESFJ’s who have had the benefit of being raised and surrounded by a strong value system that is ethical and
centered around genuine goodness will most likely be the kindest, most generous souls who will gladly
give you the shirt off of their back without a second thought. For these individuals, the selfless quality of
their personality type is genuine and pure. ESFJ’s who have not had the advantage of developing their own
values by weighing them against a good external value system may develop very questionable values. In
such cases, the ESFJ most often genuinely believes in the integrity of their skewed value system. They have
no internal understanding of values to set them straight. In weighing their values against our society, they
find plenty of support for whatever moral transgression they wish to justify. This type of ESFJ is a
dangerous person indeed. Extraverted Feeling drives them to control and manipulate, and their lack of
Intuition prevents them from seeing the big picture. They're usually quite popular and good with people,
and good at manipulating them. Unlike their ENFJ cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them
understand the real consequences of their actions. They are driven to manipulate other to achieve their own
ends, yet they believe that they are following a solid moral code of conduct.
All ESFJ’s have a natural tendency to want to control their environment. Their dominant function demands
structure and organization, and seeks closure. ESFJ’s are most comfortable with structured environments.
They're not likely to enjoy having to do things which involve abstract, theoretical concepts, or impersonal
analysis. They do enjoy creating order and structure, and are very good at tasks which require these kinds
of skills. ESFJ’s should be careful about controlling people in their lives who do not wish to be controlled.
ESFJ’s respect and believe in the laws and rules of authority, and believe that others should do so as well.
They're traditional, and prefer to do things in the established way, rather than venturing into uncharted
territory. Their need for security drives their ready acceptance and adherence to the policies of the
established system. This tendency may cause them to sometimes blindly accept rules without questioning
or understanding them.
An ESFJ who has developed in a less than ideal way may be prone to being quite insecure, and focus all of
their attention on pleasing others. He or she might also be very controlling, or overly sensitive, imagining
bad intentions when there weren't any.
ESFJ’s incorporate many of the traits that are associated with women in our society. However, male ESFJ’s
will usually not appear feminine at all. On the contrary, ESFJ’s are typically quite conscious about gender
roles and will be most comfortable playing a role that suits their gender in our society. Male ESFJ’s will be
quite masculine (albeit sensitive when you get to know them), and female ESFJ’s will be very feminine.
ESFJ’s at their best are warm, sympathetic, helpful, cooperative, tactful, down-to-earth, practical, thorough,
consistent, organized, enthusiastic, and energetic. They enjoy tradition and security, and will seek stable
lives that are rich in contact with friends and family.`,

    successDefinition: `The ESFJ is called the “caregiver”, and for good reason. Caring is the very nature of their personality; a
personality driven by feeling judgments and supported by a strong sense of the world around them. The
ESFJ not only sees how situations affect themselves and others, they are concerned about it. Everything
that makes them feel valued and successful is bound inextricably to the value and concern they need to
exchange with others. “Give and ye shall receive” is the motto of the ESFJ, whose gifts serve the most
important function in all communal human processes, from the family to the wider world of care giving
such as hospitality, primary teaching, nursing, aged care, social services, human resources and so on.
Whilst their judgments might be bound by a somewhat conventional moral code, the ESFJ always stands up
for what they are certain is the best for others. In some situations this trait can lead them into disaster,
particularly if they are thrust into an unsuitable role. The ESFJ thrives best where they can make the
decisions and organize things to suit their own way of seeing the world. Regardless however of their
particular station in life, the ESFJ is at their best when it involves caring for and about others, measuring
their success by the happiness and gratitude which is reflected back to them from the people in whose lives
they play a part.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
ESFJ’s externally mapped, feeling based view of the world not being successfully coupled to an
appropriate level of Introverted Sensation. Without this internal balance, the ESFJ’s perceptions and ideas
are determined by feeling judgments which are not in always a valid basis for understanding.
ESFJ’s are usually stable, certain, reliable and caring in their approach to life, but if unbalanced they are
likely to treat any point of view other than their own with a kind of amused indifference or a tendency to
keep those with differing attitudes and opinions at a distance. Whilst this is natural survival behavior for the
strongly expressed ESFJ personality, if they do not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing
viewpoints they come into contact with, ESFJ’s can find themselves waging a self created war against all
that opposes their own. This conflict often expresses itself in various unambiguous and simplistic “Us
verses Them” generalities, or a penchant for smugly and narrowly defining other people by arbitrary or
superstitious belief systems, which often actually symbolize and define their own conflict. At its worst, this
conflict with the obstinate and unfeeling contingent realities of the world creates a situation where the ESFJ
retreats to a kind of psychological castle where, not only none but those who have the “right” or “nice”
approach can enter, but also where the ESFJ’s feeling based and often tortured logic, attitudes and
judgments reign supreme and cannot be questioned; a place where: “give and you shall receive” can
ironically twist quickly into: “off with his head!”
The main driver to the ESFJ personality is Extraverted Feeling, whose function is to judge the relative
human value of the ideas, behaviors, situations and objects they perceive. The resulting world view is tidy,
and ordered according to its worth to the ESFJ’s own particular character: “Everything has its place and
everything in its place”. If this picture of the world is threatened by external influences, the ESFJ generally
tries to shut such new information out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the
individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the ESFJ who exercises this type of self-protection regularly
will find they can only connect and relate with those who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow
and rigid world view. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will
always find fault with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for
them to maintain the flexibility needed for a healthy relationship with the messy world outside because the
differing ways others value things is a constant affront to their personal judgments.
It is not an uncommon tendency for the ESFJ to support their feeling judgments by selectively using only
their immediate perceptions of a situation and how it appears to them. However, if this tendency is given
free reign, the resulting ESFJ personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful. The ESFJ's
auxiliary function of Introverted Sensing must be allowed to grow beyond this limit, where it is used only
to support Extraverted Feeling judgments. If the ESFJ uses Introverted Sensing only to serve this purpose,
then the ESFJ is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the ESFJ does not sufficiently
recognize and understand the vast number of contingent and differing ways in which the world is perceived
by others. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in
order to support their perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat illogical and full of
fixed and often rather staid or conventional ideas about the world. Other people are often surprised by the
simplicity, ambiguity and often unrelenting vehemence of their ideas.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ESFJ needs to focus on opening their perspective to include a more accurate
picture of the world and its ways. In order to be in a position in which the ESFJ is able to perceive and
consider data that is foreign to their value system, the ESFJ needs to recognize that their world view is not
threatened by the new information. The ESFJ must consciously tell himself/herself that the judgments of
others are not unrelated to reality; that the ideas of others are also just and valid within a wider and less
rigorous vision of the world.
The ESFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the way things appear to them.
Do they try to find the basic connections between the elements of a situation? Or, do they appreciate only
those elements which accord them a feeling of worth? At the moment when some connection or
relationship between things is perceived, is the ESFJ only concerned with whether that perception supports
something they value? Or is she/he concerned with becoming truly appraised of how things fit together in
the world? To achieve a better understanding of others and the world in which they live, the ESFJ should
try to put themselves into the minds of others, to locate and recognize how others see things, before making
judgments. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with
their carefully adjudicated system of relative worth, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should
try to see the way others might see situations, without making personal judgments about how others ought
to feel. In general, they should work on exercising their Sensation in a truly introverted sense. In other
words, they should use Sensation to recognize that all parts of a situation are necessary for its functionality
and that valuing one function or objective connection over another narrows their ability to deal with the real
world as it truly is. The ESFJ who can successfully envision the world as a realm of functioning and
connected parts which are all necessary to its balance can be quite a powerful force for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ESFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an inability
understand the connections and relationships necessary to each situation, a too conventional and dogmatic
set of values which limits the way others can relate to them, or an unrealistic and illogical view of the
world. These issues mostly stem from using Introverted Sensation in a diminished manner: the lack of a
strong internally focused viewpoint allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended set of values to
control the personality. An ESFJ who attempts to envision a more accurate and impartial view of the world
for the sake of understanding the ways of others, rather than quickly deciding how things alone affect them,
will have a clearer, more objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon adherence to
values and care for others, but also how the world relies upon structure and laws which function regardless
of their human value. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to demand that the world and
the behavior of others conform to values of right and wrong, good and bad, worthy and worthless etc. Such
well-adjusted ESFJ’s will fit happily into our society.
Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a
difficult task to suddenly start to use Sensation in an unambiguous and totally introverted direction. It's
difficult to even understand what that means, much less to incorporate that directive into your life. With
that in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your
Introverted Sensation more fully:
Take care to try and discover how others see things. Try to notice the connections they make between ideas
and objects. Don’t immediately compare your own vision of things to theirs; simply accept that for them
the world fits together in a valid way.
Think of those times and situations in your life when you felt misunderstood or disregarded by others. Now
try to understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't try to assume they would
judge as you do: "she would have to feel the same way if that happened to her", or "he would change his
tune if he saw things from my point of view". Rather, try to understand how they would truly see the
situation. Would they analyze it through a code of values, or see it as an opportunity to grasp a wider
perspective in which a solution can be found? Would it affect them personally or would they view it
impartially? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time to finding out how
the other person sees the world around them. Concentrate on really sensing the relationships within what
they describe. Tell them how you see the world and compare. Ask questions about why things seem so to
them.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself "this person has their
own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine." Remember
that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what
that person is seeing right now. What connections are they making or enacting, what thoughts are they
having? Don't pass judgment, or compare their situation to your own.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any length of time.`,

    type: "ESFP",
    name: "Extraverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Sensing with Introverted Feeling",
    epithet: "The Performer",
    description: `As an ESFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in via your five
senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according
to how you feel about them, or how they fit with your personal value system.
ESFP's live in the world of people possibilities. They love people and new experiences. They are lively and
fun, and enjoy being the center of attention. They live in the here-and-now, and relish excitement and
drama in their lives.
ESFP’s have very strong inter-personal skills, and may find themselves in the role of the peacemaker
frequently. Since they make decisions by using their personal values, they are usually very sympathetic and
concerned for other people's well-being. They're usually quite generous and warm. They are very observant
about other people, and seem to sense what is wrong with someone before others might, responding
warmly with a solution to a practical need. They might not be the best advice-givers in the world, because
they dislike theory and future-planning, but they are great for giving practical care.
ESFP is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual. They love to have fun. If the ESFP has not
developed their Thinking side by giving consideration to rational thought processing, they tend to become
over-indulgent, and place more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their duties
and obligations. They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences of their actions.
For the ESFP, the entire world is a stage. They love to be the center of attention and perform for people.
They're constantly putting on a show for others to entertain them and make them happy. They enjoy
stimulating other people's senses, and are extremely good at it. They would love nothing more than for life
to be a continual party, in which they play the role of the fun-loving host.
ESFP’s love people and everybody loves an ESFP. One of their greatest gifts is their general acceptance of
everyone. They are upbeat and enthusiastic, and genuinely like almost everybody. An ESFP is unfailingly
warm and generous with their friends, and they generally treat everyone as a friend. However, once
crossed, an ESFP is likely to make a very strong and stubborn judgment against the person who crossed
them. They are capable of deep dislike in such a situation.
The ESFP under a great deal of stress gets overwhelmed with negatives thoughts and possibilities. As an
optimistic individual who lives in the world of possibilities, negative possibilities do not sit well with them.
In an effort to combat these thoughts, they're likely to come up with simple, global statements to explain
away the problem. These simplistic explanations may or may not truly get to the nature of the issue, but
they serve the ESFP well by allowing them to get over it.
ESFP’s are likely to be very practical, although they hate structure and routine. They like to "go with the
flow", trusting in their ability to improvise in any situation presented to them. They learn best with "hands on" experience, rather than by studying a book. They're uncomfortable with theory. If an ESFP hasn't
developed their intuitive side, they may tend to avoid situations which involve a lot of theoretical thinking,
or which are complex and ambiguous. For this reason, an ESFP may have difficulty in school. On the other
hand, the ESFP does extremely well in situations where they're allowed to learn by interacting with others,
or in which they "learn by doing".
ESFP’s have a very well-developed appreciation for aesthetic beauty, and an excellent sense of space and
function. If they have the means, they're likely to have to have many beautiful possessions, and an artfully
furnished home. In general, they take great pleasure in objects of aesthetic beauty. They're likely to have a
strong appreciation for the finer things in life, such as good food and good wine.
The ESFP is a great team player. He or she is not likely to create any problems or fuss, and is likely to
create the most fun environment possible for getting the task done. ESFP’s will do best in careers in which
they are able to use their excellent people skills, along with their abilities to meld ideas into structured
formats. Since they are fast-paced individuals who like new experiences, they should choose careers which
offer or require a lot of diversity, as well as people skills.
ESFP’s usually like to feel strongly bonded with other people, and have a connection with animals and
small children that is not found in most other types. They're likely to have a strong appreciation for the
beauties of nature as well.
The ESFP has a tremendous love for life, and knows how to have fun. They like to bring others along on
their fun-rides, and are typically a lot of fun to be with. They're flexible, adaptable, genuinely interested in
people, and usually kind-hearted. They have a special ability to get a lot of fun out of life, but they need to
watch out for the pitfalls associated with living entirely in the moment`,

    successDefinition: `ESFP’s can’t help but spontaneously grasp the moment, particularly if it offers a new sensation or
experience. And while the ESFP might seem to others to only be interested in piling up new experiences, or
reliving old ones just to savor the quality of the sensations or lively enjoyment they bring, the ESFP has in
fact a far more subtle relationship to life and the world around them. Indeed, with their curious mixture of
Extraverted Sensation and Introverted Feeling, the ESFP can show a wealth of complexity in their ways,
even if to the ESFP themselves, considering such matters is felt to be a tedious and - to their way of seeing
the world - quite unnecessary task. For this reason, just defining what success means to an ESFP requires
more than simply assuming that a life filled with satisfying, quality experiences necessarily fulfills this
criteria, as the ESFP’s true needs and satisfactions will depend greatly on the strength and refinement of
their Sensation and Feeling functions. But there is one thing that defines all ESFP’s, and that is their
exuberant ability - and need - to engage with other people and express that which grips them. So, whilst
success might come through many different paths, and be felt by the ESFP in modes and preferences not
necessarily understood as success by other types, the successful ESFP will nevertheless always be found
where they can live in full and open engagement with people and able to express their talents, appreciations
and joys before the world at large.`,

      `They will not just seek entertainment and things for their own sake, but will seek always to find

      `The ESFP who augments their ability to recognize opportunities (Extraverted Sensing) with a
strong internal value system (Introverted Feeling) will find themselves more likely to attract, and
be attracted into, very rewarding relationships with others - particularly with those of the opposite
sex.`,
      `They will recognize and promote the talents of others.`,
      `They can be counted on to defend the best and most life promoting aspects of the world.`,
    ],
    potentialProblemAreas: [
      `May be seen by others as unnecessarily coarse in their behavior and life choices.`,
      `May be unable to value or may ignore the preferences and needs of others.`,
      `May perceive even the most careful and objective criticism as simply a ploy to spoil their
enjoyment of life.`,
      `May have skewed or unrealistic ideas about the feelings of others.`,
      `May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that would lead to second thoughts or a more
careful appreciation.`,
      `May blame their problems on the world at large, seeing themselves as frustrated heroes battling
against the odds.`,
      `May become totally self focused and oblivious to the havoc they wreak on others feelings.`,
      `May uncaringly use totally inappropriate social behavior simply to make a point.`,
      `May be overbearing in their judgments upon the taste and dress of others.`,
      `May come across to others as boastful and rash in their attitudes.`,
      `May rationalize the ways of the world in the most inane or simplistic ways.`,
      `May believe the most extraordinary things about inanimate objects and their workings.`,
      `May feel overwhelmed with tension and stress when driven into a situation which requires deep
and careful consideration.`,
      `Under great stress, may feel the world around them is alive with dark, unseen influences.
Another difficulty, which is not so much a problem for the ESFP but for those around them, particularly if
Introverted Thinking or Intuitive types, is that even when joyful or in the midst of life, they may be
perceived as coldly self absorbed and oblivious to the feelings of others, even when the truth is quite the
reverse. Should it somehow matter, then when in the company of such people, the ESFP should take some
trouble to express their feelings and value judgments.`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various degrees to the
common ESFP problem of being overly absorbed by the sensations and immediate apparent facts of the
external world. ESFP’s are usually very spontaneous and outgoing people who have little time for analysis
of the complexities behind the world they live in. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their
own rather shortly, waving away in particular the more intellectual and intuitive understandings of others as
irrelevant and totally secondary to the obvious realities of life. If the ESFP does not learn how to deal with
the tension that arises between, what to them is the most obvious and satisfying way to deal with the world
and those deeper intricacies which lie behind its facade, the ESFP will begin to shut out any incoming
information which produces this tension. This is a natural survival technique for the ESFP personality. The
main driver to the ESFP personality is Extraverted Sensation, whose purpose is solely to perceive the
realities of the external world and by which the ESFP orients themselves towards the things they need or
desire. If an ESFP's image of the world is threatened by demands for careful judgment or reasoning, the
ESFP shuts out the demand in order to preserve and honor their world view. This is totally natural, and
works well to protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the ESFP who exercises this type
of self-protection regularly will become not only more and more careless of other people's needs and
perspectives, but also cut off in a world where the facts and realities which they perceive become
interwoven with a belief system which supports only the ESFP’s desire driven view. Under such
circumstances they will justify their own inappropriate behaviors in the most astounding or rationally
simplistic ways, and will always find fault with others for trying to complicate and disturb what ought to be
a simple and obvious way of life. It will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships
because they will not only have unreasonable and simplistically concrete expectations, but will be unable to
understand why such expectations cannot be easily met.
It’s not an uncommon tendency for the ESFP to look to their inner world only for feelings that justify their
desires and perceptions. However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ESFP personality is too
self-centered to be happy or successful. Since the ESFP's dominant function is Extraverted Sensing, they
must balance this with an auxiliary Introverted Feeling function which is sufficiently refined to make
reasonably objective judgments about the value of the ESFP’s actions and the people and things in their
life. The ESFP makes value judgments via Introverted Intuition. This is also the ESFP's primary way of
dealing with their own internal subjective world. If the ESFP uses Introverted Feeling only to serve the
purposes of Extraverted Sensing, then the ESFP is not using Introversion effectively at all. As a result, the
ESFP does sufficiently consider the effects of their actions and perceptions sufficiently for a strong value
system to arise in their personality. They see nothing but the joys, satisfactions and sensations of the world
outside themselves, and deal with feeling only so far as it supports their need for constant stimulation and
gratification. These individuals can often come across as coarse and lustful, although can just as easily
seem the complete opposite, as refined and tasteful connoisseurs who, nevertheless, at closer quarters
reveal their complete indifference to anything but the satisfaction of their own desires.
At this point, I would like the reader to understand that, as with all personality types, serious problems are
usually only encountered by those whose dominant function is unusually strongly expressed against the
other functions. Such situations are rare and although the problems discussed here can indeed be felt to
some level by all ESFP’s, most people regardless of their personality type tend toward a balance within
both their personal and worldly relationships which occurs despite differences in personality preference; a
balance driven by the need for comfort in others and the human capacity for love. So whilst it is essential
for us to fine tune our relationships through knowledge and understanding of our differences and peculiar
needs, it is also good for us to remember that the most simple and childlike longings of the heart can also
be most powerful guides to happiness.
`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ESFP needs to focus on increasing their self understanding to allow a rational
and more objectively reasoned value system to arise within themselves. In order for the ESFP to more
validly judge the value of their desires, actions and the things they allow into their world, the ESFP needs
to know that their world view is not being threatened but qualitatively reinforced by the strength and
objectivity of their judgments. The ESFP must consciously tell himself/herself that a feeling that does not
agree with their desires or perceptions of the world is not an indictment of their character but a clue to
greater understanding.
The ESFP who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their motivation for valuing
certain actions, interests and possessions over others. Do they attend to their feelings to judge such things
according to a strong set of values which accords also with the needs of others? Or, do they judge only to
support a personal desire? At the moment when something is felt, is the ESFP concerned with adjusting
that feeling to fit in with what appears to them as the most important things in the world? Or is she/he
concerned with allowing their feelings to be fully realized? To achieve a better understanding of their
feelings, the ESFP should try to allow feelings their full force, before setting them against their strong
desires. They should be consciously aware of their tendency to discard anything that doesn't agree with
their immediate sense of appearance, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should try to see
situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments about the situations or the
other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on exercising their Feeling in a truly Introverted
sense. In other words, they should use Feeling to understand how the world of their perceptions affects their
inner life, using it to discover the values that truly matter, rather than simply to support their wishes. The
ESFP who successfully creates a strong value system can be quite a powerful force for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ESFP’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of an uncaring
attitude to anything other than the moment, an unawareness of the needs of others, or too simplistic a set of
expectations. All of these issues stem from using Introverted Feeling in a diminished manner. An ESFP
who uses feeling to judge the value of their perceptions and actions, rather than one who uses it only to
support their desires, will have a clearer, more refined appreciation of the world and what it can offer. He
or she will also be more aware of how others may feel, and will have more realistic expectations for others'
behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted ESFP’s will fit happily into our society.
Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a
difficult task to suddenly start to use Feeling in an Introverted direction. It's difficult to even understand
what that means, much less to incorporate that directive into your life. For the ESFP, the most important
thing is to recognize and understand that Feelings must not be confused with sensations or the emotions
they unleash. Quite often we say “it feels good” when we really mean that the sensation we are
experiencing is good. The sense of “Feeling” from a psychological viewpoint is that it underlies that
rational, judging factor which discriminates rightness or applicability from wrongness or misapplication,
guilt from pride etc. With this in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help you to
begin exercising your Introverted Feeling:
When a new prospect enters your life and stirs your appetite, sit with it for a moment in your mind and
allow yourself to notice whether you have a lurking judgment about it. Try to allow this judgment to come
forward on its own behalf and do not try to rationalize it nor be afraid of it. Imagine that you are hearing
this judgment from the lips of another person, or perhaps from God, anything to let it be felt objectively
within your mind. What is your Feeling function saying about what your exciting new prospect really
means to you?
Think of a situation in your life in which you are sharing your joys and enthusiasms with others, perhaps
entertaining them. Perhaps you are an entertainer. Watch the looks and body language of others as you
speak or perform and notice that not all seem to be offering the same emotional responses to your words or
actions. Each one is feeling you a different way, judging you a different way. Try to notice the same
function within yourself now, the responsive person within you who is also judging your words and
actions. How is he/she reacting to you?
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time to discovering their
values and reasons. Concentrate on really understanding why they feel as they do. Ask questions, and take
some time later to ask those same questions of yourself.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself "this person has their
own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life than they are with mine." Remember
that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you. It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what
that person is doing right now. What are they feeling, what judgments are they possibly making about what
is happening to them? Don't compare their situation to your own; just try to discover how you would feel in
their situation.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any length of time.`,

    type: "ESTJ",
    name: " Extraverted Sensing Thinking Judging",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Thinking with Introverted Sensing",
    epithet: "The Guardian",
    description: `As an ESTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and
logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in via your five senses in a literal,
concrete fashion.
ESTJ's live in a world of facts and concrete needs. They live in the present, with their eye constantly
scanning their personal environment to make sure that everything is running smoothly and systematically.
They honor traditions and laws, and have a clear set of standards and beliefs. They expect the same of
others, and have no patience or understanding of individuals who do not value these systems. They value
competence and efficiency, and like to see quick results for their efforts.
ESTJ’s are take-charge people. They have such a clear vision of the way that things should be, that they
naturally step into leadership roles. They are self-confident and aggressive. They are extremely talented at
devising systems and plans for action, and at being able to see what steps need to be taken to complete a
specific task. They can sometimes be very demanding and critical, because they have such strongly held
beliefs, and are likely to express themselves without reserve if they feel someone isn't meeting their
standards. But at least their expressions can be taken at face-value, because the ESTJ is extremely straight forward and honest.
The ESTJ is usually a model citizen, and pillar of the community. He or she takes their commitments
seriously, and follows their own standards of "good citizenship" to the letter. ESTJ enjoys interacting with
people, and likes to have fun. ESTJ’s can be very boisterous and fun at social events, especially activities
which are focused on the family, community, or work.
The ESTJ needs to watch out for the tendency to be too rigid, and to become overly detail-oriented. Since
they put a lot of weight in their own beliefs, it's important that they remember to value other people's input
and opinions. If they neglect their Feeling side, they may have a problem with fulfilling other's needs for
intimacy, and may unknowingly hurt people's feelings by applying logic and reason to situations which
demand more emotional sensitivity.
When bogged down by stress, an ESTJ often feels isolated from others. They feel as if they are
misunderstood and undervalued, and that their efforts are taken for granted. Although normally the ESTJ is
very verbal and doesn't have any problem expressing themselves, when under stress they have a hard time
putting their feelings into words and communicating them to others.
ESTJ’s value security and social order above all else, and feel obligated to do all that they can to enhance
and promote these goals. They will mow the lawn, vote, join the PTA, attend home owner’s association
meetings, and generally do anything that they can to promote personal and social security.
The ESTJ puts forth a lot of effort in almost everything that they do. They will do everything that they
think should be done in their job, marriage, and community with a good amount of energy. He or she is
conscientious, practical, realistic, and dependable. While the ESTJ will dutifully do everything that is
important to work towards a particular cause or goal, they might not naturally see or value the importance
of goals which are outside of their practical scope. However, if the ESTJ is able to see the relevance of such
goals to practical concerns, you can bet that they'll put every effort into understanding them and
incorporating them into their quest for clarity and security.`,

    successDefinition: `People with the ESTJ personality type have a high value for social order and structure. Throughout his or
her life, the ESTJ develops a set of judgment standards that they use to order events and impressions that
exist in the world. These standards are essentially social principles. The ESTJ believes very strongly in
their principles, and strongly disapproves of any violation. The ESTJ believes that their principles define
appropriate behavior and attitudes, and therefore should be followed unconditionally. Just as they naturally
create rules, and are therefore natural leaders, ESTJ’s also believe in following existing social rules. They
often lead, but can follow easily if they trust the authority of the system they're following. The ESTJ can be
quite harsh about the violation of a principle. It is more important to the ESTJ that the principle is honored
than that they consider the position or feelings of the individual who transgressed against the principle.
Their harshness of manner may damage personal relationships, until the ESTJ incorporates standards for
behavior within personal relationships into their system of social rules. The ESTJ truly enjoys being around
other people, and wants to promote traditional relationships. An ESTJ may feel successful if they are able
to live their lives within their defined system of principles, but their true and lasting success will come from
the ability to create and sustain good and lasting principles, and thus to address all situations in their life
adequately and consistently.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed to the common problem of
Extraverted Thinking overtaking the ESTJ personality to the point that all other personality functions exist
only to serve Thinking's needs. A healthy and successful personality needs to have a good balance between
its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an ESTJ, dominant Extraverted Thinking needs to be well supported by the auxiliary Introverted Sensing function. If Introverted Sensing exists only to support the
agenda of Extraverted Thinking, then neither function is living up to its potential, and the subject ESTJ is
not reaching their potential in their job or their personal relationships.
In the case where auxiliary Sensing is underused, the ESTJ will live entirely within the boundaries of their
existing principles. They will hold up their own set of principles as an inalienable representation of the
Right Thing To Do, and apply everything they encounter in life to this principle system. If they perceive
behavior that does not fit into their set of principles, they will ruthlessly judge it and shut down any
alternative view of the violation. In being so tied to their Extraverted Thinking process, they lose the ability
to truly consider incoming information, and therefore lose the ability to synergize with other people and
solve problems in an effective way. Perhaps most importantly, the ESTJ loses the ability to connect with
their own Self. They become out of touch with their own personal needs, and dissociated from their core
self. The net effect of these happenings is an ESTJ leader who expects absolute adherence to his or her
demands; who lacks the ability to see long-range implications associated with these demands; who is
unwilling to consider alternate solutions or plans; and who is dissociated from any personal priorities or
value system. Such a leader is unlikely to be effective and successful in their job or personal life, although
are likely unaware of the reasons for their problems.
It is quite common for people to allow their dominant function to overrule their personality. In the case of
the Extraverted Thinker, allowing Thinking to dominate without counter-balance can have great impact on
the social interactions of the ESTJ. Female ESTJ’s may be viewed as overbearing, controlling, or
masculine, and may not be as readily accepted by social standards. This may cause low self- esteem in the
female ESTJ. Male ESTJ’s are somewhat worse off, because social stereotypes may encourage them that
they are entitled to be domineering. They may have no interest in growing beyond their limited outlook.
Extraverted Thinking is a personality function that creates structure by identifying and adhering to logical
principles. It is a social form of judgment, in that it is defined by the external world, rather than by an inner
sense of right and wrong. The true strength of Extraverted Thinking is its highly ethical nature. It is not
swayed by individual appeals -- it believes wholeheartedly in the merit of the Principle. If the Principle
exists, then it should be followed. Once the Extraverted Thinking type has identified the principle, it is their
business to enforce that principle. The Extraverted Thinker does not expect anything back for living by that
principle. It expects that the principle should be respected without condition. In other words, the ESTJ
believes that you should do what's right because it is what's right, rather than doing what's right because
you want something in return. In this ideal sense, Extraverted Thinking judgment is the cornerstone of laws
and legal systems. Extraverted Thinking has much to offer our society, in its purity of intention.
Introverted Sensing, the auxiliary function of the ESTJ, is the means of observing data and storing it for
future reference. Introverted Sensing is capable of considering and storing huge amounts of data. When this
data is fed into the dominant Thinking function, the personality uses real data to form principles and
enforce structure upon the world. In the case where the ESTJ has an overly-dominant Thinking function,
the importance of the auxiliary Sensing function is reduced. Data cannot be seen outside of its context
within a principle. The ESTJ will not be able to see beyond the fact that a principle has been violated. They
will be unable to see the data objectively.`,
    solutions: `An ESTJ who is interested in coming into his or her own potential should consciously try to suspend
judgment until all of the facts are known. An effective ESTJ is not afraid to redefine principles when
information cannot be understood or dealt with effectively within their known systems. Practicing this sort
of behavior will help auxiliary Introverted Sensation to flourish, and thereby allow the entire personality to
become a more effective and positive force.
For example, an ESTJ friend recently told me that he was convinced that his mother's cleaning lady was a
con-artist. I asked him why he thought so, and he said "because she takes money and does absolutely
nothing." Apparently the house was not being cleaned to his standards. He believed that the cleaning lady
was paid to do a certain job, and he expected that it would be completed to a certain standard for a certain
fee. This was his principle. She violated that principle by not doing the job well enough. The fact that she
took money for a job that she didn't do was nothing less than criminal behavior to him. When I asked him if
the cleaning lady had been given directions on what specifically to clean, he said he didn't know, but that
she was a cleaning lady so she should know what to do (another principle.) We soon discovered that the
cleaning lady was paid about half the going rate for her job. When I explored this situation a bit further (out
of concern for my friend's mother) I discovered that the cleaning lady had almost no guidance on what to
clean, but that she was busy the entire time that she hired, and that she was perhaps not the cleanest of
cleaning ladies. When she was given more direction, she performed to a better standard. My assertion that
the cleaning lady kept busy the whole time that she was hired was flatly rejected by my ESTJ friend. He
would not consider that piece of information, nor would he consider the fact that she was paid much less
than the standard rate for cleaning ladies. Within his principle system, she was a con-artist, and he did not
consider data that might offer an alternate explanation.
Rather than simply rejecting the new information that became available, my ESTJ friend could have altered
his principles slightly to allow for differences in personal capabilities and results amongst individuals, and
to allow for the fact that the cleaning lady getting a lower rate of pay did offset the lower quality of service
at some level. Using the new data (made available by Introverted Sensing) to tweak and redefine his
principles would allow him to create a more effective system of principles that would be better able to
handle similar future challenges.
In general, developing Introverted Sensing is the ESTJ's key to optimizing the effectiveness and resiliency
of their principles. It will also improve their general balance of character, and therefore open the door to
growth within other aspects of their psyche.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Be willing to create new principles and change existing principles based on new facts.`,
      `If you become angry, walk away. When you allow anger to control your actions, you lose, and
quite possibly somebody else loses too. After you have dealt with your anger and calmed down,
continue with what you were doing.`,
      `Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life.
Remember that Intuitives sometimes speak in an indirect, wandering way. Try to have patience
with this, and remember that everyone has something to offer.`,
      `Remember that you have the most to learn from those people who are very different from you.
They have something to offer you, no matter how difficult it may be for you to see it at first.`,
    ],
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ESTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often associated with being
controlling of others, having unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, failing to consider others'
needs and ideas, and generally coming across too strongly. These issues stem primarily from the common
ESTJ habit of using Extraverted Thinking in a mode in which it quickly and automatically applies existing
principles against the external world, rather than taking the time to weigh their inner data against their
principles for behavior. ESTJ’s need to be able to use their rich store of internal data to feed their
principles. Insisting on adherence to steadfast principles while ignoring factual information is a recipe for
trouble, such as we have seen with various dictatorships throughout history. In order to flourish in a healthy
way, the ESTJ has to recognize the importance of their inner data stores, and needs to use all available data
to form good principles. In order to accomplish this, the ESTJ needs to recognize the importance of
Introversion, and develop the use of their highest introverted function, Introverted Sensing.

    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! You have been given the great ability to create logical, ethical principles that
transcend personal experience. Allow these principles to be as good as they can be by creating
them with consideration for all available data.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to overcome them.
Especially, resist the tendency to judge too quickly, and remember the importance of considering
other people's feelings.`,
      `Talk Through the Facts or write them down. You need to step through the facts in order to define
good principles to live by. Verbalizing them or putting them down on paper may be a valuable
tool for you.`,
      `Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you think you already know the
answer. Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.`,
      `When You Get Angry, You Lose. Your passion for your principles is admirable, but becomes
destructive when you fall into the \`Anger Trap.\` Remember that Anger is destructive to personal
relationships, and can be extremely hurtful to others. Work through your anger before you unleash
it upon others. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a non personal and dispassionate manner.`,
      `Be Yourself in Relationships Don't expect yourself to be a \`touchy-feely\` or \`warm fuzzy\` person.
Realize that your most ardent bonds start with the head, rather than the heart. You expect your
actions to speak for themselves to your loved ones. This may not be enough for some. Be aware of
other's emotional needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real
to YOU. Be yourself.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look
inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.`,
      `Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.`,
      `Resist the Urge to Control Others. You can't force others to adhere to your ways of thinking. You
may think that you know what's best for others, but you really only know how they can best act
according to your ideas of what is right. Just as you are entitled to live as you see fit, so are they.
Instead of judging and controlling others, focus on using your judgment to create better impartial
principles.`,
      `Spend Some Time Alone. Encourage the development of your introverted side. You'll find many
tangible benefits to becoming a better-rounded person.`,

    type: "ESTP",
    name: "Extraverted Sensing Thinking Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Extraverted Sensing with Introverted Thinking",
    epithet: "The Doer",
    description: `As an ESTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take things in via your five
senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally
and logically.
ESTP's are outgoing, straight-shooting types. Enthusiastic and excitable, ESTP’s are "doers" who live in
the world of action. Blunt, straight-forward risk-takers, they are willing to plunge right into things and get
their hands dirty. They live in the here-and-now, and place little importance on introspection or theory.
They look at the facts of a situation, quickly decide what should be done, execute the action, and move on
to the next thing.
ESTP’s have an uncanny ability to perceive people's attitudes and motivations. They pick up on little cues
which go completely unnoticed by most other types, such as facial expressions and stance. They're typically
a couple of steps ahead of the person they're interacting with. ESTP’s use this ability to get what they want
out of a situation. Rules and laws are seen as guidelines for behavior, rather than mandates. If the ESTP has
decided that something needs to be done, then their "do it and get on with it" attitude takes precedence over
the rules. However, the ESTP tends to have their own strong belief in what's right and what's wrong, and
will doggedly stick to their principles. The Rules of the Establishment may hold little value to the ESTP,
but their own integrity mandates that they will not under any circumstances do something which they feel
to be wrong.
ESTP’s have a strong flair for drama and style. They're fast-moving, fast-talking people who have an
appreciation for the finer things in life. They may be gamblers or spendthrifts. They're usually very good at
story telling and improvising. They typically make things up as they go along, rather than following a plan.
They love to have fun, and are fun people to be around. They can sometimes be hurtful to others without
being aware of it, as they generally do not know and may not care about the effect their words have on
others. It's not that they don't care about people; it's that their decision-making process does not involve
taking people's feelings into account. They make decisions based on facts and logic.
ESTP's least developed area is their intuitive side. They are impatient with theory, and see little use for it in
their quest to "get things done". An ESTP will occasionally have strong intuitions which are often way off base, but sometimes very lucid and positive. The ESTP does not trust their instincts, and is suspicious of
other people's intuition as well.
The ESTP often has trouble in school, especially higher education which moves into realms where theory is
more important. The ESTP gets bored with classes in which they feel they gain no useful material which
can be used to get things done. The ESTP may be brilliantly intelligent, but school will be a difficult chore
for them.
The ESTP needs to keep moving, and so does well in careers where he or she is not restricted or confined.
ESTP’s make extremely good salespersons. They will become stifled and unhappy dealing with routine
chores. ESTP’s have a natural abundance of energy and enthusiasm, which makes them natural
entrepreneurs. They get very excited about things, and have the ability to motivate others to excitement and
action. The can sell anyone on any idea. They are action-oriented, and make decisions quickly. All-in-all,
they have extraordinary talents for getting things started. They are not usually so good at following
through, and might leave those tasks to others. Mastering the art of following through is something which
ESTP’s should pay special attention to.
ESTP’s are practical, observant, fun-loving, spontaneous risk-takers with an excellent ability to quickly
improvise an innovative solution to a problem. They're enthusiastic and fun to be with, and are great
motivators. If an ESTP recognizes their real talents and operates within those realms, they can accomplish
truly exciting things.`,

    ],
    successDefinition: `With a dominant function of Extraverted Sensing, and an auxiliary function of Introverted Thinking, people
with the ESTP personality type have a heightened need for sensory experience and for tactile engagement
with their physical environment. The ESTP is most comfortable when they can treat life as a big game in
which they must be quick to use their skills in order to win. In such a game-playing scenario, the ESTP is
most likely to be the winner, as no other personality type is as quick on their feet as the ESTP.
ESTP’s have an amazingly ability to size up people in an instant and come up with an accurate ballpark
understanding of where they are coming from. The ESTP cannot help using this skill, it is natural for them,
but it brings them great satisfaction to be able to use this skill to enact some personal gain, or to “win the
game.” The ESTP is also strongly driven to tangibly interact with their immediate physical environment.
This need manifests itself in many ways, most commonly as an attraction to sports or physical challenges,
and as a desire to always be doing something. ESTP’s are the great Doers. If you want to make something
happen quickly, ask an ESTP. These inherent skills make the ESTP likely to find success professionally as
salespeople or professional athletes. However, any career that capitalizes on their people skills or their
ability to maneuver within their physical world AND gives them immediate feedback is likely to be a good
fit for the ESTP.
The ESTP’s need to be engaged with their immediate, external world makes success on a personal level
more challenging. They feel happiest when they are outside of themselves, but personal success requires
going within to get to know the self. However, once these needs are recognized, they are not mutually
exclusive. The ESTP who feeds their constant drive for new sensory experiences as well as their need for
real reflection upon those experiences and impressions will find a deeper level of personal satisfaction than
the ESTP who allows his immediate needs for sensory experiences to yank him about.
However, even those ESTP’s who have developed their ability to reflect on matters will always be
connected at some base level to the strong desire for new experiences, and will get their “bread and butter”
feelings of success from conquering challenges in their physical environment. ESTP’s need to know
they’ve got the goods, won the moment, done the job. Once given a task that intrigues them, or having
discovered something new to be tried, very little will stop them from doing all they can to meet the
challenge, and thereby achieve what they consider to be a personal success. Success to an ESTP is usually
not measured in ongoing terms, but in transient moments of achievement, moments which bring the ESTP
the needed feeling of having won the day.`,
    strengths: [
      `A great talent for reading people and knowing “where they’re at” by just watching their behavior

    explanationOfProblems: `Because the ESTP is driven to experience the world through concrete sensation, their need for sensual
experience combines with the possibilities of the moment to provide everything they feel is necessary to
life. Using Introverted Thinking only to justify or enhance their sensual needs, the ESTP can easily flow
with the world in a reckless manner, their own behavior mapped and justified by a ruling grid locked only
to the objective action of the moment. Many of the difficulties described above flow from this common
ESTP trait of attending only to the world and the people around them for the sake of satisfying their
constant need for fresh experiences and new conquests. For the ESTP who lacks the support of a well
adapted rational, judging function, the objective world remains an endlessly fascinating playground, where
the constantly changing rules of the game often provide the only real codes of conduct they live by.
Without a well developed Introverted Thinking function enabling the ESTP to reflect upon the
consequences of their actions and desires, the feelings and needs of others can seem of little concern to
them. Often, those who cannot match the ESTP round for round are considered persons of little
consequence, or valued only as useful pawns in an endless game of one-upmanship where the gratification
of the ESTP’s needs is the only object. In addition to this, because Feeling is the ESTP’s tertiary function,
its judgments tend to be colored by the unconscious background, which means that it is often used
negatively. In responding to the ESTP’s sense driven thinking assessments, such a feeling function plays
down empathy and enhances the maintenance of negative feelings about others, particularly when they do
not “go along” with the ESTP’s primary function driven ways and needs.
Under such conditions the strongly expressing ESTP, whose auxiliary Introverted Thinking function serves
only to make biased, supportive, “correct” judgments about their own behavior, will often “stand outside
the circle”, their biased judgments reducing others to a mere audience, expected to support the ESTP’s
notions without question. In relationships this can be a danger, for it means the ESTP will rarely accede to
the feeling based demands of others, nor give credit to those ideas which arise from an intuitive outlook on
life. Their behavior in this regard often borders on outright contempt or a sullen refusal to accept anything
outside their own purview.
Such strongly expressing ESTP’s can sometimes find themselves without any truly close relationships, for
their behavior often provides a strong signal to others, who sense that “here be dragons”, and consequently
offer as little as possible of their personal feelings or worldly knowledge as grist to the ESTP’s one upmanship mill. Under these circumstances, whilst the ESTP may have lots of acquaintances and partners
in fun, there will be very few who will befriend them at any truly supportive, emotional level.
Apart from the reasons given above, some narrowly expressing ESTP’s can sometimes find themselves
isolated because of the unusual things they believe about people and the world - particularly in regard to the
reasons they believe certain things happen. The ESTP is extremely familiar with the workings of the
immediate, rational world of the senses, but because their Intuition is a virtually unconscious function, their
ideas about things outside their ken can quite often be extraordinarily quaint, superstitious or just downright
bizarre, and their thinking can weave some amazing logic to support these beliefs. This rarely affects their
day to day life, for these ideas and superstitions quite often support their keenness and abilities, but in a
situation where truly intuitive or theoretical notions are considered relevant and important, the ESTP can
find themselves very much the odd man out.
Of all the personality types, the strongly expressing ESTP can be the hardest to convince that their world
view is not the only valid one; that it does not necessarily spring from the best and only way to be; that
everyone else in the world that is “normal” does not approach life in the same way as the ESTP.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ESTP needs to focus on freeing their thinking from the control of Extraverted
Sensing and allow them the space to make careful, rational judgments. Not only about the immediate,
external situation, but also about the ways in which it can be managed to create a more valuable, long term
result. The ESTP’s capacity to do this is innate; it hides just beneath the surface and takes only a few
deliberate moments to allow it to work. All the ESTP needs to do is to recognize the difference between
thinking with the moment, with the subject of their immediate sense impressions, and the thinking they do
when nothing else grasps their attention. The ESTP needs to recognize that the second kind of thinking, this
“alone with self” space, is full of potential for careful judgment of their actions and consideration of the
best course for the future. Introverted Thinking is in truth the ESTP secret weapon. It is Introverted
Thinking working in the background of their life which makes the ESTP such a potent personality.
Bringing it into the foreground, allowing its power to be no longer a secret to them is the key to ESTP
development.
I want to offer the ESTP some specific suggestions and advice here, for bringing the value of introspection
into focus it isn’t just a matter of flipping a switch in the head. One of the reasons for this is that, when
uncoupled from the fascinations of the outer world and reality, the ESTP’s Introverted Thinking tends to
get caught up in the negative judgments and images which flow from their feeling and intuitive functions;
all too easily falling into a cloudy, uncertain world of anxieties and sinister implications. The ESTP’s inner
space needs to be cleared of this often childish and ill-informed miasma of negativity. So it is necessary to
reassure yourself, to calmly and decisively insist upon quiet in your inner mind, and have faith that all
concerns will be taken care of by the “adult of the household” (the mature version of Introverted Thinking.)
Turning off the world and getting into your own space can be difficult at the beginning, but it provides the
greatest rewards. For the ESTP doesn’t need to learn how to think, they already do it extremely well – they
just need to turn their thinking upon themselves. They need to measure and evaluate their usefulness, their
actions, their relationships in ways that look for quality, and in ways to offer value to all things and people
in their lives.
Challenge yourself. Challenges are simple stuff for the ESTP, and all it really takes is a few moments of
reflection each day. Ask yourself regularly: “What am I doing? Why am I doing it? Who benefits from it?”
Ask these questions in every type of situation, and discover how the answers begin showing a path toward
not only greater understanding of self and others, but also show ways to include others in a relationship
with your whole self. Soon you will discover your feelings and intuitions coming on board with a more
positive and inclusive force. Growing yourself soon becomes easy, because it just takes the simple routine
of letting your innate power of considered thought work upon your own life, rather than only using it to
support what’s going on outside. Think about it. `,
    livingHappilyTips: `ESTP’s usually have a strong group of supporters, both at work and socially. They are often popular, their
appeal is magnetic and they attract those who would like to do the things they can do. The problems the
ESTP has fitting into the world tend to be related to the flip side of this attractive and challenging exterior,
for the deeper and more intimate side of people tends to avoid them, just as the ESTP tends to avoid the
deeper connections. ESTP’s have no trouble attracting lovers and admirers, they simply have trouble
keeping them, for once relationships begin to demand constancy and deep, feeling based connections, the
ESTP is often left wondering what the fuss was about. Their inadequacy in this regard can often make
others feel they are lacking any real feelings or desire for commitment, whilst the truth is that they simply
do not know the path to such things without a long and difficult learning period. They are more frightened
of feelings rather than unable to feel, they are more timid of commitment rather than unable to commit. In
relationships the ESTP needs reassurance, but all too often their needs are unspoken and interpreted as
inabilities.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Ask yourself what you want from a long term relationship. Now turn this around and see how your
requirements compare with others. Are you being realistic? Have you forgotten to include the needs of
others in your ideal relationship? Are you afraid of the things you need to offer, or are you just afraid that
in offering them you will lose something?
Always remember, that a relationship which adds to your personal skills and life is a valuable one, while a
relationship which limits your ability to be yourself is not going to work. Now try to see how your own
demands and needs might add to another, and what they might take away from them.
Don’t be afraid of letting your feelings show, even if they frighten you for their weakness or showing your
own vulnerability. More often than not, such honesty is the beginning of the kind of relationship that can
lead you to grow.
Your best partner is going to be the one who fills your private space, your thinking space, as well as your
senses. Try to talk to others about what you think. Discover yourself in your thoughts and let relationships
grow through your letting the other person into your inner world. Discuss your fears and limits and
discover the strength available to you from the support of another who may have what you need.`,
    ],
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Give yourself every opportunity to show your innate skills. If you are not in
a relationship or a job which allows this to happen, it might be time to discover ways to change
this. Remember, your strengths derive from being able to deal with the world, with situations
where getting things done, where opportunities to surmount difficulty exist.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses. Try to be straight up with yourself. You have limitations others find as
strengths. So what? You don’t have to hide behind a curtain of fear just because you have
difficulty with feelings or sorting out your inner perceptions. Allow yourself to be who you are
and at the same time let others help you be more honest with your limitations.`,
      `Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others will help you to
develop your separate, inner reality, make you a “real” person to them even without all that
external activity. How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your overall
health and happiness.`,
      `Don't Be Afraid to Show Emotion. Your inferior functions want you to be still a child inside, and
that makes you run, that makes you want to prove yourself even more. You don’t have to prove
anything to anyone in this regard. Everyone feel emotion and everyone is a little child inside. Find
those people whose eyes tell you that you are not alone, and let them hear your child’s voice.`,
      `Respect Your Need for Action. Understand that you need to be actively working with your
environment to be \`in the groove\` with life. Don't chastise yourself for not being the sort to sit
around and read a book or watch a movie. Choose a partner and companions who value active
lifestyles, but remember to allow yourself time out to consider how their input into your life will
change it. Don’t just follow your nose – life is not an endless party or expedition.`,
      `Recognize the Differences in Others. Realize that everyone is different, not just a little different,
but very different. Everyone has their place and value. You need to notice those values and places,
places where you cannot easily fit. You can learn from these people, for they have gifts you can
use, gifts they offer simply by being who they are. Try figuring out their psychological type for
yourself and notice how certain types can lift you out of negative feelings just by being who they
are`,
      `It's OK to Get Out of your Comfort Zone. Understand that the only way to grow is to get outside
of your comfort zone. If you're uncomfortable with an idea or situation because you're not sure
how to act, that's good! That's an opportunity for growth.`,
      `Identify and Express Your Feelings. You may have a hard time figuring out exactly how you feel
about someone that you're involved with. It's important that you do figure this out. Don't lead
someone on with your ambivalence. If you determine that you value the person, tell them so every
time you think of it. This is the best way to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to
promote a long-lasting relationship.`,
      `Be Aware that You can Fail, and that it is OK. Not every mountain can be climbed, not every
customer will be satisfied, no matter how hard you try or no matter what tricks you bring to bear.
Getting beaten is an opportunity to reflect upon what is important, what really matters in life. Next
time you will take up a challenge more worthy of your skills, and more valuable to others. You
can be a champion, and it will be at your own game. Try to let it be a game of life, where
everyone wins if you do.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself with fear and dark imaginings. Expect the best, and the
best will come.`,

    type: "INFJ",
    name: "Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Intuition with Extraverted Feeling",
    epithet: "The Protector",
    description: `As an INFJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in primarily via
intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things according to how you feel about
them, or how they fit with your personal value system.
INFJ's are gentle, caring, complex and highly intuitive individuals. Artistic and creative, they live in a
world of hidden meanings and possibilities. Only one percent of the population has an INFJ Personality
Type, making it the rarest of all the types.
INFJ’s place great importance on having things orderly and systematic in their outer world. They put a lot
of energy into identifying the best system for getting things done, and constantly define and re-define the
priorities in their lives. On the other hand, INFJ’s operate within themselves on an intuitive basis which is
entirely spontaneous. They know things intuitively, without being able to pinpoint why, and without
detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. They are usually right, and they usually know it. Consequently,
INFJ’s put a tremendous amount of faith into their instincts and intuitions. This is something of a conflict
between the inner and outer worlds, and may result in the INFJ not being as organized as other Judging
types tend to be. Or we may see some signs of disarray in an otherwise orderly tendency, such as a
consistently messy desk.
INFJ’s have uncanny insight into people and situations. They get "feelings" about things and intuitively
understand them. As an extreme example, some INFJ’s report experiences of a psychic nature, such as
getting strong feelings about there being a problem with a loved one, and discovering later that they were in
a car accident. This is the sort of thing that other types may scorn and scoff at, and the INFJ themselves
does not really understand their intuition at a level which can be verbalized. Consequently, most INFJ’s are
protective of their inner selves, sharing only what they choose to share when they choose to share it. They
are deep, complex individuals, who are quite private and typically difficult to understand. INFJ’s hold back
part of themselves, and can be secretive.
But the INFJ is as genuinely warm as they are complex. INFJ’s hold a special place in the heart of people
who they are close to, who are able to see their special gifts and depth of caring. INFJ’s are concerned for
people's feelings, and try to be gentle to avoid hurting anyone. They are very sensitive to conflict, and
cannot tolerate it very well. Situations which are charged with conflict may drive the normally peaceful
INFJ into a state of agitation or charged anger. They may tend to internalize conflict into their bodies, and
experience health problems when under a lot of stress.
Because the INFJ has such strong intuitive capabilities, they trust their own instincts above all else. This
may result in an INFJ stubbornness and tendency to ignore other people's opinions. They believe that
they're right. On the other hand, INFJ is a perfectionist who doubts that they are living up to their full
potential. INFJ’s are rarely at complete peace with themselves - there's always something else they should
be doing to improve themselves and the world around them. They believe in constant growth, and don't
often take time to revel in their accomplishments. They have strong value systems, and need to live their
lives in accordance with what they feel is right. In deference to the Feeling aspect of their personalities,
INFJ’s are in some ways gentle and easy going. Conversely, they have very high expectations of
themselves, and frequently of their families. They don't believe in compromising their ideals.
INFJ is a natural nurturer; patient, devoted and protective. They make loving parents and usually have
strong bonds with their offspring. They have high expectations of their children, and push them to be the
best that they can be. This can sometimes manifest itself in the INFJ being hard-nosed and stubborn. But
generally, children of an INFJ get devoted and sincere parental guidance, combined with deep caring.
In the workplace, the INFJ usually shows up in areas where they can be creative and somewhat
independent. They have a natural affinity for art, and many excel in the sciences, where they make use of
their intuition. INFJ’s can also be found in service-oriented professions. They are not good at dealing with
minutia or very detailed tasks. The INFJ will either avoid such things, or else go to the other extreme and
become enveloped in the details to the extent that they can no longer see the big picture. An INFJ who has
gone the route of becoming meticulous about details may be highly critical of other individuals who are
not.
The INFJ individual is gifted in ways that other types are not. Life is not necessarily easy for the INFJ, but
they are capable of great depth of feeling and personal achievement.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Most of the problems described above are a result of Introverted iNtuition overtaking the INFJ's personality
to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Introverted iNtuition. A healthy personality
needs to have a good balance between its dominant and auxiliary functions. For an INFJ, the dominant
Introverted iNtuition needs to be well-supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function. If
Extraverted Feeling exists only to support the desires of Introverted iNtuition, then neither function is being
used to its potential.
Introverted iNtuition is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and sees everything from
many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a personality, it has the effect of constantly
bombarding the psyche with new information to consider. Introverted iNtuition is sort of like a framework
for understanding that exists in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive
framework. If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that person
must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are constantly taking in
information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively lengthy manner in order to be
understood. That presents quite a challenge to the INFJ. It's not unusual for an INFJ to feel overwhelmed
with all of the things that he or she needs to consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation.
When Introverted iNtuition dominates the INFJ such that the other functions cannot serve their own
purposes, we find the INFJ cutting off information that it needs to consider. If the psyche is presented with
information that looks anything like something that Introverted iNtuition has processed in the past, it uses
Extraverted Feeling to quickly reject that information. The psyche uses Extraverted Feeling to reject the
ideas, rather than taking the information into its intuitive framework, and therefore potentially causing that
framework to be reshaped and redefined.
Using Extraverted Feeling in this manner may effectively serve the immediate needs of Introverted
iNtuition, but it is not ideal. It causes the INFJ to not consider information that may be useful or critical in
developing a real understanding of an issue. It may cause the INFJ to come off as too strongly opinionated
or snobbish to others.
The better use of Extraverted Feeling for an INFJ would be to use it to assess the INFJ's rich insights and
weigh them against the external world. When the INFJ personality uses Extraverted Feeling to cut off
incoming information, rather than to judge internal intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like
getting the answers to a test without having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer
right away, rather than to have to figure everything out. For the INFJ, who has a tremendous amount of
information and "studying" that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts. Most INFJ’s will do
this to some extent. The real problems occur when an INFJ personality has become so imbalanced that its
owner is extremely self-important and rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INFJ needs to focus on applying their judgment to things only after they have
gone through their intuition. In other words, the INFJ needs to consciously try not to use their judgment to
dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot
effectively judge something that they don't understand. The INFJ needs to take things entirely into their
intuition in order to understand them. It may be necessary to give your intuition enough time to work
through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of understanding. INFJ’s need to
focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but rather to support their intuitive framework.
An INFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of their judgments,
and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something external to themselves, or are they
judging something that they have sifted through their intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to
be able to understand its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an INFJ will judge something
without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to
judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some INFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with not
knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, and with having unreasonable expectations for others'
behaviors. Both of these issues stem from using Extraverted Feeling primarily to dismiss external ideas,
rather than to sort through their own intuitions.
An INFJ who uses Extraverted Feeling in this diminished manner may become so strongly opinionated that
they form rigid and unreasonable expectations for others. They may feel so strongly about things that they
become very passionate and agitated when they feel that something has gone wrong. In these cases, it's not
uncommon for the INFJ to express their displeasure with biting sarcasm. They become so emotionally
upset that they are generally not aware of how their behavior comes across to others. Even if the
consequences of their attitude and behavior are pointed out to them, they may be agitated to the point that
they don't care. This kind of situation can be devastating to the INFJ on many levels, and should be
avoided. There isn't much that can be done once the INFJ has reached the point where they are too upset to
care about others, but the INFJ can prevent this problem from occurring by ensuring that they never get to
that point.
How can you, as an INFJ, ensure that you won't get that upset? It probably seems to you that these kinds of
upsets are caused by external circumstances and situations. Well, that's not really true. It's true that things
will happen over which you have no control. But you certainly have control over how you perceive these
things, or more appropriately, how you *judge* these things.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask questions if necessary.
Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea. Try not to begin judging anything about the
idea until you have understood it entirely.
Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person. Take in that
person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with whom you're speaking.
If you become upset, walk away immediately. DO NOT express anger. When you get angry, you lose.
After you have calmed down, apologize for leaving and continue with what you were doing.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life. Remember that
people with the Sensing preference need to be communicated with in a direct, concise manner. Speak
plainly and simply with Sensors, giving "yes" or "no" answers.
Try to be on good terms with all people, even those that you consider beneath you. Try to understand that
everybody has something to offer`,

perspective. Give yourself time to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others.
You'll find externalizing your internal intuitions to be a valuable exercise.`,
      `Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you don't respect the person
generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After all, everybody has
something to offer, and nobody knows everything. Steven Covey says it so well when he says:
"Seek first to understand, and then to be understood."`,
      `When You Get Angry, You Lose. Your passion and intensity are strong assets, but can be very
harmful if you allow yourself to fall into the \`Anger Trap\`. Remember that Anger is destructive to
your personal relationships. Work through your anger before you impress it upon others, or you
will likely find yourself alone. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled
effectively in a non-personal and dispassionate manner.`,
      `Keep Your Eye on the Big Picture Watch out for your tendency to become obsessed with details.
If you find yourself feeling very, very strongly about a small detail, take a big step back and make
sure that you can still see the goal. You're not going to get there if you get mired in the details.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look
inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.`,
      `Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side of everything.
Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is a light side to every dark side.
Remember that positive situations are created by positive attitudes. Expect the best, and the best
will come forward.`,
      `Relax! Do yourself a favor and learn how to effectively unwind. Get exercise and restful sleep.
Take vacations. Engage in relaxing activities. Take care of yourself and your loved ones by
learning to let go of your passion and intensity for a respite.`,

    type: "INFP",
    name: "Introverted Intuitive Feeling Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Feeling with Extraverted Intuition",
    epithet: "The Idealist",
    description: `As an INFP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your personal value
system. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in primarily via your
intuition.
INFP's, more than other iNtuitive Feeling types, are focused on making the world a better
place for people. Their primary goal is to find out their meaning in life. What is their
purpose? How can they best serve humanity in their lives? They are idealists and
perfectionists, who drive themselves hard in their quest for achieving the goals they have
identified for themselves
INFP’s are highly intuitive about people. They rely heavily on their intuitions to guide
them, and use their discoveries to constantly search for value in life. They are on a
continuous mission to find the truth and meaning underlying things. Every encounter and
every piece of knowledge gained gets sifted through the INFP's value system, and is
evaluated to see if it has any potential to help the INFP define or refine their own path in
life. The goal at the end of the path is always the same - the INFP is driven to help people
and make the world a better place.
Generally thoughtful and considerate, INFP’s are good listeners and put people at ease.
Although they may be reserved in expressing emotion, they have a very deep well of
caring and are genuinely interested in understanding people. This sincerity is sensed by
others, making the INFP a valued friend and confidante. An INFP can be quite warm
with people he or she knows well.
INFP’s do not like conflict, and go to great lengths to avoid it. If they must face it, they
will always approach it from the perspective of their feelings. In conflict situations,
INFP’s place little importance on who is right and who is wrong. They focus on the way
that the conflict makes them feel, and indeed don't really care whether or not they're right.
They don't want to feel badly. This trait sometimes makes them appear irrational and
illogical in conflict situations. On the other hand, INFP’s make very good mediators, and
are typically good at solving other people's conflicts, because they intuitively understand
people's perspectives and feelings, and genuinely want to help them.
INFP’s are flexible and laid-back, until one of their values is violated. In the face of their
value system being threatened, INFP’s can become aggressive defenders, fighting
passionately for their cause. When an INFP has adopted a project or job which they're
interested in, it usually becomes a "cause" for them. Although they are not detail-oriented
individuals, they will cover every possible detail with determination and vigor when
working for their "cause".
When it comes to the mundane details of life maintenance, INFP’s are typically
completely unaware of such things. They might go for long periods without noticing a
stain on the carpet, but carefully and meticulously brush a speck of dust off of their
project booklet.
INFP’s do not like to deal with hard facts and logic. Their focus on their feelings and the
Human Condition makes it difficult for them to deal with impersonal judgment. They
don't understand or believe in the validity of impersonal judgment, which makes them
naturally rather ineffective at using it. Most INFP’s will avoid impersonal analysis,
although some have developed this ability and are able to be quite logical. Under stress,
it's not uncommon for INFP’s to misuse hard logic in the heat of anger, throwing out fact
after (often inaccurate) fact in an emotional outburst.
INFP’s have very high standards and are perfectionists. Consequently, they are usually
hard on themselves, and don't give themselves enough credit. INFP’s may have problems
working on a project in a group, because their standards are likely to be higher than other
members' of the group. In group situations, they may have a "control" problem. The INFP
needs to work on balancing their high ideals with the requirements of every day living.
Without resolving this conflict, they will never be happy with themselves, and they may
become confused and paralyzed about what to do with their lives.
INFP’s are usually talented writers. They may be awkward and uncomfortable with
expressing themselves verbally, but have a wonderful ability to define and express what
they're feeling on paper. INFP’s also appear frequently in social service professions, such
as counseling or teaching. They are at their best in situations where they're working
towards the public good, and in which they don't need to use hard logic.
INFP’s who function in their well-developed sides can accomplish great and wonderful
things, which they will rarely give themselves credit for. Some of the great, humanistic
catalysts in the world have been INFP’s.`,

    successDefinition: `INFP’s are creative, sensitive souls who take their lives very seriously. They seek
harmony and authenticity in their relationships with others. They value creativity,
spirituality, and honoring the individual self above all else. They are very tuned into
inequity and unfairness against people, and get great satisfaction from conquering such
injustices. An INFP is a perfectionist who will rarely allow themselves to feel successful,
although they will be keenly aware of failures. INFP’s also get satisfaction from being in
touch with their creativity. For the INFP, personal success depends upon the condition of
their closest relationships, the development of their creative abilities, and the continual
support of humanity by serving people in need, fighting against injustice, or in some
other way working to make the world a better place to be.`,
    strengths: [
      `Highly creative, artistic and spiritual, they can produce wonderful works of art,
music and literature. INFP’s are natural artists. They will find great satisfaction if
they encourage and develop their artistic abilities. That doesn't mean that an INFP
has to be a famous writer or painter in order to be content. Simply the act of
\`creating\` will be a fulfilling source of renewal and refreshment to the INFP. An
INFP should allow himself or herself some artistic outlet, because it will add
enrichment and positive energy to their life.`,
      `They're more spiritually aware than most people, and are more in touch with their
soul than others. Most INFP’s have strong Faith. Those that don't may feel as if
they're missing something important. An INFP should nourish their faith.`,
      `INFP’s are very aware of social injustice, and empathize with the underdog. Their
empathy for the underdog and hyper-awareness of social injustice makes them
extremely compassionate and nurturing towards disadvantaged members of our
society. INFP’s will feel most useful and fulfilled when they are fighting to help
people who have been misfortunate in our society. They may be teachers,
ministers, writers, counselors or psychologists, but they will most likely all spend
extra time trying to help people with special problems. An INFP can find a
tremendous amount of satisfaction by enacting some kind of social change that
will help the underdog.`,
      `They're usually good listeners who genuinely want to hear about someone's
problems, and genuinely want to help them. This makes them outstanding
counselors, and good friends. An INFP may find great satisfaction from
volunteering as a counselor.`,
      `They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They
believe that an individual has the right to be themselves, without having their
attitudes and perspectives brought under scrutiny. Accordingly, they have a great
deal of tolerance and acceptance dealing with people who might encounter
negative judgment from society in general. They can see something positive in
everyone. They believe in individuals. If they give themselves the opportunity, an
INFP can become a much-needed source of self-esteem and confidence for people
who cannot find it on their own. In this way, they can nurture a \`sick soul\` back
to health.`,
      `Usually deep and intelligent, they're able to grasp difficult concepts with relative
ease. They usually do quite well academically, and will find that educating their
minds nourishes their need to think deeply.`,
    ],
    gifts: [
      `They will have a great deal of insight into people's characters. They will quickly and
thoroughly understand where a person is coming from by assessing their motives and
feelings. These well-developed INFP individuals make outstanding psychologists (such
as Isabel Briggs Myers herself) and counselors. They might also be great fiction writers,
because they're able to develop very complex, real characters.
They will quickly understand different situations, and quickly grasp new concepts. They
will find that they're able to do anything that they put their mind to, although they may
not find it personally satisfying. Things may seem to come easily to these INFP’s.
Although they're able to conquer many different kinds of tasks and situations, these
INFP’s will be happiest doing something that seems truly important to them. Although
they may find that they can achieve the \`mainstream\` type of success with relative ease,
they are not likely to find happiness along that path, unless they are living their lives with
authenticity and depth.
The INFP who augments their strong, internal value system (Introverted Feeling) with a
well-developed intuitive way of perceiving the world (Extraverted iNtuition) can be a
powerful force for social change. Their intense values and strong empathy for the
underprivileged, combined with a reliable and deeply insightful understanding of the
world that we live in, creates an individual with the power to make a difference (such as
Mother Teresa - an INFP).`,

      `May have difficulty maintaining close relationships, due to unreasonable
expectations`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common INFP problem of only taking in data that justifies their personal
opinions. INFP’s are usually very intense and sensitive people, and feel seriously
threatened by criticism. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own as
criticism of their own perspective. If the INFP does not learn how to deal with this
perceived criticism, the INFP will begin to shut out the incoming information that causes
them pain. This is a natural survivalist technique for the INFP personality. The main
driver to the INFP personality is Introverted Feeling, whose purpose is to maintain and
honor an intensely personal system of values and morals. If an INFP's personal value
system is threatened by external influences, the INFP shuts out the threatening data in
order to preserve and honor their value system. This is totally natural, and works well to
protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the INFP who exercises this
type of self-protection regularly will become more and more unaware of other people's
perspectives, and thus more and more isolated from a real understanding of the world that
they live in. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and
will always find fault with the external world for problems that they have in their lives. It
will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have
unreasonable expectations, and will be unable to accept blame.
It’s not an uncommon tendency for the INFP to look to the external world primarily for
information that will support their ideas and values. However, if this tendency is given
free reign, the resulting INFP personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful.
Since the INFP's dominant function to their personality is Introverted Feeling, they must
balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted iNtuitive function. The INFP takes in
information via Extraverted iNtuition. This is also the INFP's primary way of dealing
with the external world. If the INFP uses Extraverted iNtuition only to serve the purposes
of Introverted Feeling, then the INFP is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a
result, the INFP does not take in enough information about the external world to have a
good sense of what's going on. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with
the world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These
individuals usually come across as selfish and unrealistic. Depending on how serious the
problem is, they may appear to be anything from "a bit eccentric" to "way out there".
Many times other people are unable to understand or relate to these people.
`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INFP needs to focus on opening their perspective to include
a more accurate picture of what is really going on in the world. In order to be in a
position in which the INFP is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their
internal value system, the INFP needs to know that its value system is not threatened by
the new information. The INFP must consciously tell himself/herself that an opinion that
does not concede with their own is not an indictment of their entire character.
The INFP who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their
motivation for taking in information. Do they take in information to better understand a
situation or concept? Or, do they take in information to support a personal idea or cause?
At the moment when something is perceived, is the INFP concerned with twisting that
perception to fit in with their personal values? Or is she/he concerned with absorbing the
information objectively? To achieve a better understanding of the external world, the
INFP should try to perceive information objectively, before fitting it into their value
system. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that
doesn't agree with their values, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should
try to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments
about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on
exercising their iNtuition in a truly Extraverted sense. In other words, they should use
iNtuition to take in information about the world around them for the sake of
understanding the world, rather than take in information to support their own conclusions.
The INFP who successfully perceives things objectively may be quite a powerful force
for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some INFP’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of
an unawareness of appropriate social behavior, an unawareness of how they come across
to others, or unrealistic expectations of others. Any one of these three issues stem from
using Extraverted iNtuition in a diminished manner. An INFP who takes in information
for the sake of understanding the world around them, rather than one who takes in
information only to support their own ideas, will have a clearer, more objective
understanding of how society values social behaviors and attitudes. He or she will also be
more aware of how they are perceived by others, and will have more realistic
expectations for others' behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted INFP’s will fit
happily into our society.
Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various
personality functions, it's a difficult task to suddenly start to use iNtuition in an
Extraverted direction. It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to
incorporate that directive into your life. With that in mind, I am providing some specific
suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your Extraverted iNtuition more fully:
Take care to notice what people look like in different social situations. Look at their hair,
their skin, their makeup (or lack thereof), their clothes, the condition of their clothes, their
shoes, their facial expressions. Don't compare others to your own appearance, or pass
judgment on their appearance, simply take in the information.
Think of a situation in your life in which you weren't sure how to behave. Now try to
understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't compare their
behavior to your own, i.e. "she would know better than me what to do", or "why is it so
easy for her, but so hard for me". Rather, try to understand how they would see the
situation. Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken
seriously or lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or
comparing it to your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time
to talking about the other person. Concentrate on really understanding where that person
is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself
"this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life
than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you.
It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is doing right now. What
things are they encountering, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or
compare their situation to your own.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any
length of time.`,
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Encourage your natural artistic abilities and creativity.
Nourish your spirituality. Give yourself opportunities to help the needy or
underprivileged.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some traits are strengths and
some are weaknesses. Facing and dealing with your weaknesses doesn't mean that
you have to change who you are; it means that you want to be the best you
possible. By facing your weaknesses, you are honoring your true self, rather than
attacking yourself.`,
      `Express Your Feelings. Don't let unexpressed emotions build up inside of you. If
you have strong feelings, sort them out and express them, don’t let them build up
inside you to the point where they become unmanageable!`,
      `Listen to Everything. Try not to dismiss anything immediately. Let everything
soak in for awhile, and then apply judgment.`,
      `Smile at Criticism. Remember that people will not always agree with you or
understand you, even if they value you greatly. Try to see disagreement and
criticism as an opportunity for growth. In fact, that is exactly what it is.`,
      `Be Aware of Others. Remember that there are 15 other personality types out there
who see things differently than you see them. Try to identify other people's types.
Try to understand their perspectives.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Remember that YOU have more control over your
life than any other person has.`,
      `Be Gentle in Your Expectations. You will always be disappointed with others if
you expect too much of them. Being disappointed with another person is the best
way to drive them away. Treat others with the same gentleness that you would
like to be treated with.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself by assuming the worst. Remember that a
positive attitude often creates positive situations.`,
      `When in Doubt, Ask Questions! Don't assume that the lack of feedback is the
same thing as negative feedback. If you need feedback and don't have any, ask for
it.`,

    type: "INTJ",
    name: "Introverted Intuitive Thinking Judging",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Intuition with Extraverted Thinking",
    epithet: "The Scientist",
    description: `As an INTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in
primarily via your intuition. Your secondary mode is external, where you deal with things
rationally and logically.
INTJ's live in the world of ideas and strategic planning. They value intelligence,
knowledge, and competence, and typically have high standards in these regards, which
they continuously strive to fulfill. To a somewhat lesser extent, they have similar
expectations of others.
With Introverted Intuition dominating their personality, INTJ’s focus their energy on
observing the world, and generating ideas and possibilities. Their mind constantly gathers
information and makes associations about it. They are tremendously insightful and
usually are very quick to understand new ideas. However, their primary interest is not
understanding a concept, but rather applying that concept in a useful way. Unlike the
INTP, they do not follow an idea as far as they possibly can, seeking only to understand it
fully. INTJ’s are driven to come to conclusions about ideas. Their need for closure and
organization usually requires that they take some action.
INTJ's tremendous value and need for systems and organization, combined with their
natural insightfulness, makes them excellent scientists. An INTJ scientist gives a gift to
society by putting their ideas into a useful form for others to follow. It is not easy for the
INTJ to express their internal images, insights, and abstractions. The internal form of the
INTJ's thoughts and concepts is highly individualized, and is not readily translatable into
a form that others will understand. However, the INTJ is driven to translate their ideas
into a plan or system that is usually readily explainable, rather than to do a direct
translation of their thoughts. They usually don't see the value of a direct transaction, and
will also have difficulty expressing their ideas, which are non-linear. However, their
extreme respect of knowledge and intelligence will motivate them to explain themselves
to another person who they feel is deserving of the effort.
INTJ’s are natural leaders, although they usually choose to remain in the background
until they see a real need to take over the lead. When they are in leadership roles, they are
quite effective, because they are able to objectively see the reality of a situation, and are
adaptable enough to change things which aren't working well. They are the supreme
strategists - always scanning available ideas and concepts and weighing them against
their current strategy, to plan for every conceivable contingency.
INTJ’s spend a lot of time inside their own minds, and may have little interest in the other
people's thoughts or feelings. Unless their Feeling side is developed, they may have
problems giving other people the level of intimacy that is needed. Unless their Sensing
side is developed, they may have a tendency to ignore details which are necessary for
implementing their ideas.
The INTJ's interest in dealing with the world is to make decisions, express judgments,
and put everything that they encounter into an understandable and rational system.
Consequently, they are quick to express judgments. Often they have very evolved
intuitions, and are convinced that they are right about things. Unless they complement
their intuitive understanding with a well-developed ability to express their insights, they
may find themselves frequently misunderstood. In these cases, INTJ’s tend to blame
misunderstandings on the limitations of the other party, rather than on their own difficulty
in expressing themselves. This tendency may cause the INTJ to dismiss others input too
quickly, and to become generally arrogant and elitist.
INTJ’s are ambitious, self-confident, deliberate, long-range thinkers. Many INTJ’s end
up in engineering or scientific pursuits, although some find enough challenge within the
business world in areas which involve organizing and strategic planning. They dislike
messiness and inefficiency, and anything that is muddled or unclear. They value clarity
and efficiency, and will put enormous amounts of energy and time into consolidating
their insights into structured patterns.
Other people may have a difficult time understanding an INTJ. They may see them as
aloof and reserved. Indeed, the INTJ is not overly demonstrative of their affections, and
is likely to not give as much praise or positive support as others may need or desire. That
doesn't mean that he or she doesn't truly have affection or regard for others, they simply
do not typically feel the need to express it. Others may falsely perceive the INTJ as being
rigid and set in their ways. Nothing could be further from the truth, because the INTJ is
committed to always finding the objective best strategy to implement their ideas. The
INTJ is usually quite open to hearing an alternative way of doing something.
When under a great deal of stress, the INTJ may become obsessed with mindless
repetitive, sensate activities, such as over-drinking. They may also tend to become
absorbed with minutia and details that they would not normally consider important to
their overall goal.
INTJ’s need to remember to express themselves sufficiently, so as to avoid difficulties
with people misunderstandings. In the absence of properly developing their
communication abilities, they may become abrupt and short with people, and
isolationists.
INTJ’s have a tremendous amount of ability to accomplish great things. They have
insight into the Big Picture, and are driven to synthesize their concepts into solid plans of
action. Their reasoning skills give them the means to accomplish that. INTJ’s are most
always highly competent people, and will not have a problem meeting their career or
education goals. They have the capability to make great strides in these arenas. On a
personal level, the INTJ who practices tolerances and puts effort into effectively
communicating their insights to others has everything in his or her power to lead a rich
and rewarding life.`,

    successDefinition: `People with the INTJ personality type are serious, analytical and often perfectionist. They
look at a problem or idea from multiple perspectives and systematically analyze it with
objective logic, discarding things that turn out to be problematic, and evolving their own
understanding of something when new information turns out to be useful. There is no
other personality type who does this as naturally as the INTJ. They are natural scientists
and mathematicians. Once given an idea, they are driven to understand it as thoroughly as
possible. They usually have very high standards for their own understanding and
accomplishments, and generally will only value and consider other individuals who have
shown that they meet or surpass the INTJ's own understanding on a given issue. INTJ’s
value clarity and conciseness, and have little esteem for behaviors and attitudes that are
purely social. Social "niceties" often seem unnecessary and perhaps even not genuine to
the INTJ, who is always seeking to improve their substantive understanding. INTJ's
highly value social interaction that is centered around the meaningful exchange of ideas,
but they usually dismiss the importance of being friendly or likeable in other social
contexts, and they are likely to be uncomfortable with interactions that are primarily
emotional, rather than logical. INTJ’s value structure, order, knowledge, competence, and
logic. Above all, they value their own ideas and intuitions about the world. An INTJ's
feeling of success depends primarily upon their own level of understanding and
accomplishment, but also depends upon the level of structure in their life, and their ability
to respect the intelligence and competence of those who share their life.`,

    explanationOfProblems: `Most of the problems described above are a result of Introverted iNtuition overtaking the
INTJ's personality to the point that all of the other functions become slaves to Introverted
iNtuition. A healthy personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and
auxiliary functions. For an INTJ, the dominant Introverted iNtuition needs to be well supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Thinking function. If Extraverted Thinking exists
only to support the desires of Introverted iNtuition, then neither function is being used to
its potential.
Introverted iNtuition is a personality function that constantly gathers information, and
sees everything from many different perspectives. As the dominant player in a
personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with new information
to consider. Introverted iNtuition is sort of like a framework for understanding that exists
in the mind. As something is perceived, it is melded into the existing intuitive framework.
If an entirely new piece of information is perceived by the Introverted iNtuitive, that
person must redefine their entire framework of reference. So, Introverted iNtuitives are
constantly taking in information about the world that needs to be processed in a relatively
lengthy manner in order to be understood. That presents quite a challenge to the INTJ. It's
not unusual for an INTJ to feel overwhelmed with all of the things that he or she needs to
consider in order to fully understand an idea or situation.
When Introverted iNtuition dominates the INTJ such that the other functions cannot serve
their own purposes, we find the INTJ cutting off information that it needs to consider. If
the psyche is presented with information that looks anything like something that
Introverted iNtuition has processed in the past, it uses Extraverted Thinking to quickly
reject that information. The psyche uses Extraverted Thinking to reject the ideas, rather
than analyzing the information within its intuitive framework, and therefore reduces the
likelihood that the framework will have to be reshaped and redefined.
Using Extraverted Thinking in this manner serves the INTJ's psyche in two ways: 1) it
saves it the energy that would have to be expended to truly consider new information, and
2) it protects the INTJ's sacred inner world. In either case, it is not ideal. It causes the
INTJ to not consider information that may be useful or critical in developing a real
understanding of an issue. It also probably causes the INTJ to come off as too strongly
opinionated or snobbish to others.
The better use of Extraverted Thinking for an INTJ would be to use it to assess the INTJ's
rich insights and weigh them against the external world. When the INTJ personality uses
Extraverted Thinking to cut off incoming information, rather than to judge internal
intuitions, it is effectively cheating itself. It's like getting the answers to a test without
having to really understand the questions. It's easier to get the answer right away, rather
than to have to figure everything out. For the INTJ, who has a tremendous amount of
information and "studying" that needs to be done, it's very tempting to take shortcuts.
Most INTJ’s will do this to some extent. The real problems occur when an INTJ
personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely self-important and
rarely consider anyone else's opinions or ideas.
`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INTJ needs to focus on applying their judgment to things
only after they have gone through their intuition. In other words, the INTJ needs to
consciously try not to use their judgment to dismiss ideas prematurely. Rather, they
should use their judgment against their own ideas. One cannot effectively judge
something that they don't understand. The INTJ needs to take things entirely into their
intuition in order to understand them. It may be necessary to give your intuition enough
time to work through the new information so that it can rebuild its global framework of
understanding. INTJ’s need to focus on using their judgment not to dismiss ideas, but
rather to support their intuitive framework.
An INTJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of
their judgments, and their motivation for making judgments. Are they judging something
external to themselves, or are they judging something that they have sifted through their
intuition? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand its usefulness
in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an INTJ will judge something without properly
understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to understand, then to
judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some INTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally
associated with not knowing (or caring) how they come across to others, with having
unreasonable expectations for others' behaviors, and with not putting forth effort to meet
others' emotional needs. These issues stem primarily from the common INTJ habit of
using Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally, rather than internally, and therefore
diminish the importance of the external world, and increase the importance of the INTJ's
own internal world. INTJ’s who recognize that their knowledge and understanding (and
therefore general happiness and feeling of success) can be enriched by the synergy of
other people's knowledge and understanding will find that they can be committed to their
rich internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with others. In order to
accomplish this, the INTJ needs to recognize the importance of extraversion, and develop
their highest extraverted function, Extraverted Thinking.
An INTJ who uses Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally rather than internally
may become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations
for others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others
may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others.
This will preserve the sanctity of the INTJ's inner world of ideas, but will reduce a lot of
valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the
development of the INTJ's rich structural framework of understanding. In extreme cases,
the INTJ may find himself or herself quite along and lonely.
More commonly, an INTJ's interpersonal problems will occur when they express their
displeasure to those close to them in very biting and hurtful terms. Everyone needs
emotional distance at one time or another and the INTJ wants more than most types.
Perhaps this is why INTJ’s are famous for their biting sarcasm. An INTJ's internal world
is extremely important to them. They may be protecting their internal world by using
sarcasm to keep others at an emotional distance, or they may be sarcastic with others
because they believe that they have the more evolved and logical understanding of the
issue at hand, and seek to cut off the spurious input that they're receiving. This is an
important distinction to recognize. An INTJ who is seeking an emotional respite can find
ways to be alone that don't require injuring feelings and damaging relationships. When
distance is required, the INTJ should just "leave". If an explanation is necessary, an INTJ
should use their Extraverted Thinking to explain their need rationally and objectively,
rather than using Extraverted Thinking to insult the other person, and therefore prod them
into leaving.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask
questions if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea.
Try not to begin judging anything about the idea until you have understood it entirely.
Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person.
Take in that person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with
whom you're speaking.
If you become upset, walk away immediately. DO NOT express anger. When you get
angry, you lose. After you have calmed down, apologize for leaving and continue with
what you were doing.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you encounter frequently in your life.
Remember that people with the Sensing preference need to be communicated with in a
direct, concise manner. Speak plainly and simply with Sensors, giving "yes" or "no"
answers.
Try to be on good terms with all people, even those that you consider beneath you. Try to
understand that everybody has something to offer.
When you make judgments or decisions, try to be aware of your motivation for making
the judgment. Are you more interested in finding fault externally, or in improving your
own understanding? Seek first to understand, and then to judge`,

    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Do things that allow your brilliant intuition and logical
abilities to flourish. Explore the fascinating worlds of science, mathematics, law
and medicine. Give your mind an outlet for its exceptional analytical abilities, and
watch them grow.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to
overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal
ideas and intuitions, rather than as a means of disregarding other people's ideas.`,
      `Talk Through Your Thoughts. You need to step through your intuitions in order to
put them into perspective. Give yourself time to do this, and take advantage of
discussing ideas with others. You'll find externalizing your internal intuitions to
be a valuable exercise. If you don't have someone to discuss your ideas with, try
expressing your ideas clearly in writing.`,
      `Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you don't respect the
person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After
all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. Steven
Covey says it so well when he says: \`Seek first to understand, and then to be
understood.`,
      `When You Get Angry, You Lose. Your passion and intensity are strong assets,
but can be very harmful if you allow yourself to fall into the \`Anger Trap\`.
Remember that Anger is destructive to your personal relationships. Work through
your anger before you impress it upon others, or you will likely find yourself
alone. Disagreements and disappointments can only be handled effectively in a
non-personal and dispassionate manner.`,
      `Respect your Need for Intellectual Compatibility Don't expect yourself to be a
\`touchy-feely\` or \`warm-fuzzy\` person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with
others will start with the head, rather than the heart. Be aware of other's emotional
needs, and express your genuine love and respect for them in terms that are real to
YOU. Be yourself.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other
people. Look inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than
you have.`,
      `Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side
of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is
a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by
positive attitudes. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.`,
      `Don't Get Isolated! Recognize the value that the external world represents to you,
and interact with it in the style that's natural to you. Join clubs and internet e-mail
lists that house in-depth discussions of topics that you're interested in. Seek and
foster friendships with others of like competence and capacity for understanding.
Extravert in your own style.`,

    type: "INTP",
    name: "Introverted Intuitive Thinking Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Thinking with Extraverted Intuition",
    epithet: "The Thinker",
    description: `As an INTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things
in primarily via your intuition.
INTP's live in the world of theoretical possibilities. They see everything in terms of how
it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. They live primarily inside their own
minds, having the ability to analyze difficult problems, identify patterns, and come up
with logical explanations. They seek clarity in everything, and are therefore driven to
build knowledge. They are the "absent-minded professors", who highly value intelligence
and the ability to apply logic to theories to find solutions. They typically are so strongly
driven to turn problems into logical explanations, that they live much of their lives within
their own heads, and may not place as much importance or value on the external world.
Their natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding may turn into a feeling of
personal responsibility to solve theoretical problems, and help society move towards a
higher understanding.
INTP’s value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to generate
new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They approach problems and
theories with enthusiasm and skepticism, ignoring existing rules and opinions and
defining their own approach to the resolution. They seek patterns and logical
explanations for anything that interests them. They're usually extremely bright, and able
to be objectively critical in their analysis. They love new ideas, and become very excited
over abstractions and theories. They love to discuss these concepts with others. They may
seem "dreamy" and distant to others, because they spend a lot of time inside their minds
musing over theories. They hate to work on routine things - they would much prefer to
build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation of the system to others.
They are intensely interested in theory, and will put forth tremendous amounts of time
and energy into finding a solution to a problem with has piqued their interest.
INTP’s do not like to lead or control people. They're very tolerant and flexible in most
situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been violated or challenged, in
which case they may take a very rigid stance. The INTP is likely to be very shy when it
comes to meeting new people. On the other hand, the INTP is very self-confident and
gregarious around people they know well, or when discussing theories which they fully
understand.
The INTP has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of personal
subjectivity or feelings. They strive constantly to achieve logical conclusions to
problems, and don't understand the importance or relevance of applying subjective
emotional considerations to decisions. For this reason, INTP’s are usually not in-tune
with how people are feeling, and are not naturally well-equipped to meet the emotional
needs of others.
The INTP may have a problem with self-aggrandizement and social rebellion, which will
interfere with their creative potential. Since their Feeling side is their least developed
trait, the INTP may have difficulty giving the warmth and support that is sometimes
necessary in intimate relationships. If the INTP doesn't realize the value of attending to
other people's feelings, he or she may become overly critical and sarcastic with others. If
the INTP is not able to find a place for themselves which supports the use of their
strongest abilities, they may become generally negative and cynical. If the INTP has not
developed their Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware of their
environment, and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type tasks, such as bill paying and dressing appropriately.
For the INTP, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed correctly and
succinctly. They are likely to express themselves in what they believe to be absolute
truths. Sometimes, their well thought-out understanding of an idea is not easily
understandable by others, but the INTP is not naturally likely to tailor the truth so as to
explain it in an understandable way to others. The INTP may be prone to abandoning a
project once they have figured it out, moving on to the next thing. It's important that the
INTP place importance on expressing their developed theories in understandable ways. In
the end, an amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person who understands
it.
The INTP is usually very independent, unconventional, and original. They are not likely
to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity and security. They usually
have complex characters, and may tend to be restless and temperamental. They are
strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought patterns which allow them to
analyze ideas in new ways. Consequently, a lot of scientific breakthroughs in the world
have been made by the INTP.
The INTP is at his best when he can work on his theories independently. When given an
environment which supports his creative genius and possible eccentricity, the INTP can
accomplish truly remarkable things. These are the pioneers of new thoughts in our
society.`,

    ],
    successDefinition: `People with the INTP personality type are global thinkers. They see everything as one
giant Entity that is connected, and seek knowledge about that Entity. They constantly
seek the Truth, and have ultimate respect for the Truth. It is not easy for the INTP to
reach a conclusion about the Truth. Their auxiliary function of Extraverted Intuition
allows them to absorb the many complexities in our world, and they are driven to
consider each of these complexities before reaching a conclusion. Once they have
reached a conclusion, or discovered a Truth, they are *very* particular about the way that
Truth is expressed and understood. They want to know that the principles of their
understanding have been understood correctly, and demand absolute precision and
correctness from others when describing these principles. They also apply these standards
to themselves when communicating their knowledge. If they take the time to develop
their communication so that it meets their own approval, they can be extremely good
educational writers.
In addition to their immense respect for metaphysical principles, facts, and Truths, the
INTP highly respects logic and the way that the mind works logically when seeking to
master some subject or situation. They get great pleasure from engaging in logical acts
that require quick, spatial reasoning, such as mind games, or time-based IQ tests. The
INTP shines in this realm. Introverted Thinking is an "action-based" kind of logic. In the
case of the INTP (as opposed to ISTP), the action may or may not occur in a physical
place outside of the INTP's mind, but it is experienced with lightning speed in the current
moment, based on current objects, using subjectively understood "actions" of reason.
The INTP is happiest in situations in which they can use logic regularly in an effort to
uncover Truths about the Entity. Their ability to be effective in these efforts, as well as
their ability to deal with people and feel comfortable with their place in the world, will be
in large part dependent on the development of Extraverted Intuition. Although they have
more simple needs from interpersonal relationships than most other types have, it's very
important that they keep up their extraverted relationships, rather than going it alone.
INTP’s who isolate themselves rarely feel happy or successful. The INTP's feeling of
success depends upon their opportunities to exercise their active mind, their opportunities
to seek and find Truth, and the condition of their relationships and extraverted life.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common INTP problem of only taking in information that relates to or
supports their own life experience. The INTP is driven to work with and understand his
or her world by applying logic (an immediate, spatial, "fuzzy" logic) to the current
situation. Although they generally seek to uncover truths, they don't always have a goal
in mind to achieve from the logical process. The act or process of using logic is
rewarding to the INTP. In their zeal for the satisfaction that comes from mastering a
problem or situation, INTP’s often selectively choose to put themselves in situations in
which they have the opportunity to exercise these skills. That's certainly not a problem.
Most personality types choose to do the things that they're best at most often. Such is the
nature of capitalizing upon our strengths. The problem rears its ugly head when the goal
of the INTP becomes to achieve their personal satisfaction at all costs.
It is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with what you
find rewarding, and what you're really good at. However, it sometimes happens that we
take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and objective understanding of
the world for a more narrow vision that is easier and comfortable for us to deal with. The
INTP affects this problem when they stop taking in information in a truly objective sense,
and instead only take in information that can be worked through logically.
The dominant function of the INTP is Introverted Thinking. This function is supported
closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Extraverted Intuition. Extraverted
Intuition perceives the world and sends information into the psyche, where it is processed
by Introverted Thinking. An INTP who uses their Extraverted Intuition function in a
diminished way is one who perceives information for the sole purpose of feeding
Introverted Thinking, rather than taking everything in objectively. They are less
concerned with understanding something for the sake of understanding than they are with
feeding a piece of data into their Thinking function. Information that is not logical is
dismissed as unimportant. They may reject information that is not consistent with their
logical view of themselves, or with their understanding of a situation. Well-developed
Extraverted Intuition perceives situations with depth and global understanding. It
recognizes possibilities. Introverted Thinking makes conclusions. If an INTP's psyche is
serving the purposes of Introverted Thinking above all else, then logical conclusions
become more important than possibilities. In such cases, the INTP picks and chooses
information from Extraverted Intuition that is interesting to them from the perspective of
reaching logical conclusions. This keeps the INTP focused on reaching logical
conclusions, but it prevents them from taking in any information that doesn't work well
with their logical functioning. This includes things like love, emotions, social
expectations, etc. These things are very important to many people in the world, and
cannot be discarded from consideration if one hopes to really understand other people
and the society that we live in. When the INTP dismisses the importance of data that can't
be handled by their Thinking function, they are dismissing the importance of ideas that
are central to half of the personality types' way of life (approximately half of the human
population uses Feeling primarily for decision making). An INTP who wants to
understand people and wants to recognize value in both logical and non logical ideas will
strive to take in as much information as possible about the world for the purposes of
improving their understanding,
The INTP who suffers from diminished use of Extraverted Intuition is likely to be very
cutting and derisive towards people who express disagreement with the INTP. Without a
sufficiently diverse perception of the Extraverted world, the INTP is unlikely to
understand the principles of human interaction, and is unlikely to recognize the
tremendous value of getting along with others and having good relationships.
For example, an INTP that I know (Bob) and his wife recently adopted a 7 year old girl
(Kelly). The family lives in a foreign country and makes it back to the U.S. for Christmas
most years. Last year, Bob's relatives from the U.S. spoiled Kelly with lots of Christmas
gifts to let her know that she was welcome and valued in their family. When Bob and his
family left the country after Christmas, they did not bring any of Kelly's Christmas gifts
with them. Bob's relatives were all extremely hurt and upset by this fact. When they
confronted Bob about this, he claimed that they were wrong. He said that he had done the
packing himself and was sure that nothing had been left behind. Bob's family has a large
stack of clothes and toys that were meant for Kelly, but Bob insists to this day that they
are wrong. He is not seeing the situation objectively with Extraverted Intuition. Rather,
he dismisses the evidence because it doesn't support his own vision of himself or of that
particular situation.
The INTP's inferior (fourth) function is Extraverted Feeling. This means that the INTP is
not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with social expectations. In
fact, the INTP is likely to reject the importance of social rituals, rules, and expectations.
This is a natural weak point for the INTP, which no doubt causes strife to the INTP and
their love partner. This weakness can be overcome by developing their Extraverted
Intuition to the point that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external
world. They don't have to use Extraverted Feeling to understand how to act in situations.
They can perceive the expected behavior from their Extraverted Intuition function.
However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that support their
existing way of life, then they are not learning from Extraverted Intuition at all. They are
not growing their understanding of social and intimate behaviors - rather, they are
reducing the importance of this type of understanding to their own life. In these
situations, INTP’s shy away from very close personal relationships, and feel more
vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations that involve expressing their
emotions. In extreme cases, they reject social interaction entirely. They tend to dislike
everyone, and interact with the world with the primary purpose of getting rid of the
offending person. Most INTP’s will have bad days during which they don't much feel like
dealing with people. The problem occurs when every day becomes a bad day.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the INTP needs to focus on taking in as much information as
possible through Extraverted Intuition. He or she needs to allow themselves to get into
situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different from the
situations that they would normally choose in life. The INTP learns from experience, so
the best way for the INTP to grow as a person is to open him or herself to new
experiences. Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something "new" that is
actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill. Your task, as a person
interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective fashion, and
how you fit into the world, rather than how the world fits into your life.
The INTP should also pay close attention to their motivations when perceiving new
information. Are they perceiving with an open mind or with an agenda? Are they seeking
to truly understand something, or are they more concerned with turning the information
into a logical conclusion? Seek first to understand, then to judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `The problems that INTP’s have with regards to fitting into our world are not usually
related to platonic friendships. Usually, the INTP has trouble finding and maintaining a
love relationship. The INTP usually has relatively simple needs and expectations from
their mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their mates have more
complex demands. They don't understand their mate's needs, and may feel inadequate to
meeting them. They get very uncomfortable with a situation as they perceive that they are
expected to do something that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship.
They generally mask their fear and discomfort by reducing the importance of the
relationship to themselves and others, or by putting the failure off onto the ridiculous
expectations of their ex-mate. Outside of a relationship, they feel more unloved and
unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship because they fear rejection and
hurt.
Most INTP’s experience relationship difficulties at some point in their lives. The INTP
with a well-developed Extraverted Intuition will find relationships more satisfying and
easier to deal with. Accordingly, we offer some general suggestions for dealing with
relationships, as well as some advice that will help the INTP develop their Extraverted
Intuition.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Figure out how you feel about the other person. Do not falsely express love, or lead
someone on with your ambivalence.
Don't expect yourself to be a master at the "touchy-feely" game. Be yourself, but
remember that there is a basic assumption of human decency that must be adhered to in
relationships. If you're not sure what that means, take special care to observe how people
in "good" committed relationships behave towards each other, so that you can determine
where the lines are drawn.
Pair yourself with an Extraverted Thinker (ESTJ or ENTJ) who is less likely to assume
that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback.
Realize and accept that for you a satisfying relationship will start with the head, and
move on towards the heart.
Expanding your world and experiences will expand your understanding of human
expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and
encounter in your life.
Take care to notice what people look like in different social situations. Notice their hair,
makeup (or lack thereof), the condition of their clothes, their shoes, their facial
expressions. Don't compare others to your own appearance, simply take notice of it.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, spend at least half of the time
talking about them. Concentrate on really understanding where the person is coming from
with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. Remember that they have their own lives
going on. Try to visualize what that person is doing, and imagine what kinds of things
that person is thinking about. Don't pass judgment, just think about it.`,

      `Feed Your Strengths! Realize your gift at mastering logical problems and

Much of your sense of well-being will come from these experiences.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! We all have weaknesses. Recognizing your weaknesses
for what they are (without beating yourself up) will give you the power to change

      `Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others

overall health and happiness.`,
      `Listen to Everything Try not to dismiss anything immediately. Let it soak in, and
then apply judgment. Try not to dismiss things that are illogical - they are not
illogical.`,
      `Be Aware of Others Understand that everyone has their own lives and their own
perspectives. Everyone has something to offer. Try to identify people's
personality type.`,
      `Recognize Social Principles. Realize that our society functions around some basic
social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are
recognized and upheld. In a democracy, people vote. At a red stoplight, people
stop. If people stopped voting because it wasn't important them, who would be in
power? If people stopped stopping at red stop lights because it didn't fit into their
plans, how could we drive safely? Your priorities and plans are important, but you
must recognize that the external world's agenda is also important. Don't dismiss
the importance of principles that don't affect your life directly.`,
      `Get Out of Your Comfort Zone Understand that the only way to grow is to get
outside of your comfort zone. If you're uncomfortable with an idea or situation
because you're not sure how to act, that's good! That's an opportunity for growth.`,
      `Identify and Express Your Feelings You may have a hard time understanding how
you feel about someone. It's important that you do figure this out. Don't lead
someone on with your ambivalence. If you determine that you value the person,
tell them so every time you think of it. This is the best way to make them feel
secure in your affections, and so to promote a long-lasting relationship.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself Remember that no one has more control over your
life than you have. Don't be a victim.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself with fear and dark expectations.
Remember that a positive attitude often creates positive situations.`,

    type: "ISFJ",
    name: "Introverted Sensing Feeling Judging",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Sensing with Extraverted Feeling",
    epithet: "The Nurturer",
    description: `As an ISFJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in
via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where
you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your
personal value system.
ISFJ's live in a world that is concrete and kind. They are truly warm and kind-hearted,
and want to believe the best of people. They value harmony and cooperation, and are
likely to be very sensitive to other people's feelings. People value the ISFJ for their
consideration and awareness, and their ability to bring out the best in others by their firm
desire to believe the best.
ISFJ’s have a rich inner world that is not usually obvious to observers. They constantly
take in information about people and situations that is personally important to them, and
store it away. This tremendous store of information is usually startlingly accurate,
because the ISFJ has an exceptional memory about things that are important to their value
systems. It would not be uncommon for the ISFJ to remember a particular facial
expression or conversation in precise detail years after the event occurred, if the situation
made an impression on the ISFJ.
ISFJ’s have a very clear idea of the way things should be, which they strive to attain.
They value security and kindness, and respect traditions and laws. They tend to believe
that existing systems are there because they work. Therefore, they're not likely to buy
into doing things in a new way, unless they're shown in a concrete way why it’s better
than the established method.
ISFJ’s learn best by doing, rather than by reading about something in a book, or applying
theory. For this reason, they are not likely to be found in fields which require a lot of
conceptual analysis or theory. They value practical application. Traditional methods of
higher education, which require a lot of theorizing and abstraction, are likely to be a
chore for the ISFJ. The ISFJ learns a task best by being shown its practical application.
Once the task is learned, and its practical importance is understood, the ISFJ will
faithfully and tirelessly carry through the task to completion. The ISFJ is extremely
dependable.
The ISFJ has an extremely well-developed sense of space, function, and aesthetic appeal.
For that reason, they're likely to have beautifully furnished, functional homes. They make
extremely good interior decorators. This special ability, combined with their sensitivity to
other's feelings and desires, makes them very likely to be great gift-givers - finding the
right gift which will be truly appreciated by the recipient.
More so than other types, ISFJ’s are extremely aware of their own internal feelings, as
well as other people's feelings. They do not usually express their own feelings, keeping
things inside. If they are negative feelings, they may build up inside the ISFJ until they
turn into firm judgments against individuals which are difficult to change, once set. Many
ISFJ’s learn to express themselves, and find outlets for their powerful emotions.
Just as the ISFJ is not likely to express their feelings, they are also not likely to let on that
they know how others are feeling. However, they will speak up when they feel another
individual really needs help, and in such cases they can truly help others become aware of
their feelings.
The ISFJ feels a strong sense of responsibility and duty. They take their responsibilities
very seriously, and can be counted on to follow through. For this reason, people naturally
tend to rely on them. The ISFJ has a difficult time saying "no" when asked to do
something, and may become over-burdened. In such cases, the ISFJ does not usually
express their difficulties to others, because they intensely dislike conflict, and because
they tend to place other people's needs over their own. The ISFJ needs to learn to
identify, value, and express their own needs, if they wish to avoid becoming over-worked
and taken for granted.
ISFJ’s need positive feedback from others. In the absence of positive feedback, or in the
face of criticism, the ISFJ gets discouraged, and may even become depressed. When
down on themselves or under great stress, the ISFJ begins to imagine all of the things that
might go critically wrong in their life. They have strong feelings of inadequacy, and
become convinced that "everything is all wrong", or "I can't do anything right".
The ISFJ is warm, generous, and dependable. They have many special gifts to offer, in
their sensitivity to others, and their strong ability to keep things running smoothly. They
need to remember to not be overly critical of themselves, and to give themselves some of
the warmth and love which they freely dispense to others.`,

    successDefinition: `ISFJ’s are the homemakers, caretakers and facilitators of the world. Their strong sense of
duty, hard-working tendencies and ability to respond quickly to what is suitable to a
particular situation are great assets. With a dominant function that quickly grasps the
qualities inherent within the external world, and a secondary function that weighs such
perceptions against their value within this world, the ISFJ has a great talent for
discovering the aesthetic and essential qualities compatible with and relevant to a
particular real world situation. This means that, not only within the world of objects, but
also in their relationships with people, ISFJ’s are gifted with the ability to recognize and
understand the comfort and surroundings suitable to a secure and pleasing existence. And
they can do this with a decisiveness which might make others wonder if the ISFJ was not
in fact getting their answers from some form of intuitive understanding rather than what
is really a vast library of carefully related memory images and value judgments. An ISFJ
will always feel best when their world a place of quality and reassurance, both for
themselves and others. Success for an ISFJ means being able to fulfill a role providing
value for others and ordering their world in a way in which safety and security is
balanced against a genuine respect for the aesthetic and positive qualities of life.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the ISFJ’s internally mapped and abstract view of the world not being
successfully coupled to an appropriate level of Extroverted feeling. Without this rational
external balance, the ISFJ’s opposing unconscious functions can wreak havoc upon the
order and sense of the ISFJ’s perceptions and ideas. ISFJ’s are usually stable, certain,
reliable and deft in their approach to life. But if unbalanced, they are likely to treat any
point of view other than their own with a kind of cold dismay, and if pressed hard will
tend to shut out the existence of problems caused by others differing attitudes and
opinions. If the ISFJ does not learn how to deal with the wide range of differing world
views they come into contact with, they can find themselves closed into a lonely little
corner of the world in which only their own feelings of safety and certainty are
maintained. This is a natural survival technique for the extreme ISFJ personality.
The main driver to the ISFJ personality is Introverted Sensing, whose function is to
define the properties of and locate and recognize the sometimes abstract and innate
qualities of and between the objects of the outer world. If an ISFJ’s picture of the world
is threatened by external influences, the ISFJ generally tries to shut such new information
out of their lives. This is totally natural, and works well to protect the individual psyche
from getting hurt. However, the ISFJ who exercises this type of self-protection regularly
will become closed within a small and ever decreasing circle of those family and friends
who do not actively disturb their increasingly narrow and rigid world view. They will
always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and will always find fault
with the outside world for problems that they have in their lives. It will be difficult for
them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have a negatively
polarized and therefore limited ability to communicate outside of the box of their own
security needs.
It is not an uncommon tendency for the ISFJ to support their ideas and values by using
only the value judgments they make about the world and other peoples behavior.
However, if this tendency is given free reign, the resulting ISFJ personality is too self centered to be happy or successful. Since the ISFJ's dominant function is Introverted
Sensing, they must balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted Feeling function. If the
ISFJ uses Extraverted Feeling only to serve the purposes of Introverted Sensing, then the
ISFJ is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result, the ISFJ does not sufficiently
recognize and sympathize with the way feelings affect the behavior of others in the world
to have a good sense of why things happen as they do. They see nothing but their own
perspective, and deal with the world only so far as they need to in order to support their
perspective. These individuals usually come across as somewhat judgmental and full of
fixed and often rather ambiguously polarized ideas about the world. Other people are
often surprised by the vehemence of their ideas and are usually unable to understand how
they came by them.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISFJ needs to focus on opening their perspective to include
a more accurate picture of the feelings and value judgments of others. In order to be in a
position in which the ISFJ is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their
internal value system, the ISFJ needs to recognize that their world view is not threatened
by the new information. The ISFJ must consciously tell himself/herself that emotional
affects in others are not unrelated to reality; that the feelings of others are also just and
valid within a wider and less rigorous vision of the world.
The ISFJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their
motivation for deciding what is good and bad, right and wrong. Do they try to find the
feeling values of others in a situation? Or, do they value only those feelings which
support a personal idea or cause? At the moment when something is felt, is the ISFJ only
concerned with whether that feeling supports something they recognize as correct? Or is
she/he concerned with becoming truly empathetic? To achieve a better understanding of
others and the world in which they live, the ISFJ should try to put themselves into the
minds of others, to locate and recognize how they have come to feel the way they do,
before making judgments. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard
anything that doesn't agree with their carefully ordered concepts, and work towards
lessening this tendency. They should try to feel the way others would feel in situations,
without making personal judgments about the actual situations. In general, they should
work on exercising their Feeling in a truly extraverted sense. In other words, they should
use Feeling to locate the their true connections to and relationship with others for the sake
of gaining a wider perspective, rather than only allowing such feeling values to support
their own conclusions. The ISFJ who successfully feels things objectively may be quite a
powerful force for positive change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ISFJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of
an inability to flow with what is, a too negative or correcting attitude which dismays
others, or unrealistic ideals and ideas about the world. These issues mostly stem from
using Extraverted Feeling in a diminished manner: the lack of a strong externally focused
value system allowing an often ambiguous and yet strongly defended world view which
has little relation to concrete reality to control the personality. An ISFJ who attempts to
feel and value the feelings of others for the sake of understanding the world around them,
rather than quickly deciding how they and they alone feel, will have a clearer, more
objective understanding of how society is dependant not only upon structure and correct
behavior, but also how human values make it just what it is and not something else
perhaps more desirable. He or she will also be more comfortable and less likely to
demand that the world and the behavior of others conform to some abstract code of being.
Such well-adjusted ISFJ’s will fit happily into our society. Unless you really understand
Psychological Type and the nuances of the various personality functions, it's a difficult
task to suddenly start to use Feeling in an unambiguous and totally extraverted direction.
It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to incorporate that directive
into your life. With that in mind, I am providing some specific suggestions that may help
you to begin exercising your Extraverted Feeling more fully:
Take care to try and discover why others feel the way they do. Try to notice the
connections between their feelings and the way they see the world. Don’t immediately
compare your own value judgments about the world to theirs; simply accept that for them
this is a real and perfectly valid way of responding.
Think of those times and situations in your life when you felt misunderstood or
disregarded by others. Now try to understand how one or two other people would see the
situation. Don't try to assume they would judge as you do: "she would have to feel the
same way if that happened to her", or "he would change his tune if he saw things from
my point of view". Rather, try to understand how they would truly see the situation.
Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken seriously or
lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or comparing it to
your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time
to finding out how the other person feels about what they are describing. Concentrate on
really sensing their emotional state. Tell them how you feel and compare. Ask questions
about why they feel as they do.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself
"this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life
than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you.
It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is feeling right now.
What emotions are they enacting, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or
compare their situation to your own.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any
length of time.`,
    tenRulesToLive: [

      `Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some things are never going to

change who you are; it means that you are giving yourself opportunities to grow.

By facing your weaknesses, you honor your true self and that of others.`,
      `Discover the World of Others. Don't let yourself fall into the trap of thinking you
always know what is right for others. Open your heart to the possibility of
understanding that their true needs are something that must be discovered
through relationship, and recognition that their world might be very different, yet
just as valid as your own.`,
      `Don’t be too hasty. Try to let things settle before you make a judgment, allowing
others to discover the best for themselves while you feel your way into their way

      `Look Carefully at the World. Remember, things are not always what they seem
on the surface. You might need to look deeper to discover the truth, particularly
when it seems you are sure of your first quick judgment. There are layers of
meaning and truth beneath everything.`,
      `Try to Let Others Take Some of the Load. By letting others help, you are not
letting things get out of control, but are validating their own need to be a part of
your life. Remember, it is better to guide another to see your point of view than
keeping them out of the picture.`,
      `Be Accountable to Others. Remember that they need to understand you and your
needs too. Express your feelings and reasons and let them become partners to
your goals.`,
      `Don’t Hem Yourself in. Staying in your comfort zone is self defeating in the
end. Try to make every day one where you get out and discover a little
something different about the world and others. This will broaden your horizons
and bring new ideas and opportunities into focus.`,
      `Assume the Best and Seek for it. Don't wait for others to live up to your
expectations. Every person has a goldmine of worth in them, just as every

    type: "ISFP",
    name: "Introverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Feeling with Extraverted Sensing",
    epithet: "The Artist",
    description: `As an ISFP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit into your value system.
Your secondary mode is external, where you take things in via your five senses in a
literal, concrete fashion.
ISFP's live in the world of sensation possibilities. They are keenly in tune with the way
things look, taste, sound, feel and smell. They have a strong aesthetic appreciation for art,
and are likely to be artists in some form, because they are unusually gifted at creating and
composing things which will strongly affect the senses. They have a strong set of values,
which they strive to consistently meet in their lives. They need to feel as if they're living
their lives in accordance with what they feel is right, and will rebel against anything
which conflicts with that goal. They're likely to choose jobs and careers which allow
them the freedom of working towards the realization of their value-oriented personal
goals.
ISFP’s tend to be quiet and reserved, and difficult to get to know well. They hold back
their ideas and opinions except from those who they are closest to. They are likely to be
kind, gentle and sensitive in their dealings with others. They are interested in contributing
to people's sense of well-being and happiness, and will put a great deal of effort and
energy into tasks which they believe in.
ISFP’s have a strong affinity for aesthetics and beauty. They're likely to be animal lovers,
and to have a true appreciation for the beauties of nature. They're original and
independent, and need to have personal space. They value people who take the time to
understand the ISFP, and who support the ISFP in pursuing their goals in their own,
unique way. People who don't know them well may see their unique way of life as a sign
of carefree light-heartedness, but the ISFP actually takes life very seriously, constantly
gathering specific information and shifting it through their value systems, in search for
clarification and underlying meaning.
ISFP’s are action-oriented individuals. They are "doers", and are usually uncomfortable
with theorizing concepts and ideas, unless they see a practical application. They learn
best in a "hands-on" environment, and consequently may become easily bored with the
traditional teaching methods, which emphasize abstract thinking. They do not like
impersonal analysis, and are uncomfortable with the idea of making decisions based
strictly on logic. Their strong value systems demand that decisions are evaluated against
their subjective beliefs, rather than against some objective rules or laws.
ISFP’s are extremely perceptive and aware of others. They constantly gather specific
information about people, and seek to discover what it means. They are usually
penetratingly accurate in their perceptions of others.
ISFP’s are warm and sympathetic. They genuinely care about people, and are strongly
service-oriented in their desire to please. They have an unusually deep well of caring for
those who are close to them, and are likely to show their love through actions, rather than
words.
ISFP’s have no desire to lead or control others, just as they have no desire to be led or
controlled by others. They need space and time alone to evaluate the circumstances of
their life against their value system, and are likely to respect other people's needs for the
same.
The ISFP is likely to not give themselves enough credit for the things which they do
extremely well. Their strong value systems can lead them to be intensely perfectionist,
and cause them to judge themselves with unnecessary harshness.
The ISFP has many special gifts for the world, especially in the areas of creating artistic
sensation, and selflessly serving others. Life is not likely to be extremely easy for the
ISFP, because they take life so seriously, but they have the tools to make their lives and
the lives of those close to them richly rewarding experiences.`,

    successDefinition: `ISFP’s are creative, sensitive souls with a great capacity for love. They seek harmony,
validation, and affection in their relationships with others. They value creativity and
spirituality. Very sensitive and easily hurt by rejection and harshness, they are sometimes
drawn to turn their love towards creatures who will love them back unconditionally, such
as animals and small children. They believe heartily in unconditional love, and in an
individual's right to be themselves without being judged harshly for who they are. Of all
of the types, the ISFP is most likely to believe that "Love is the answer." For the ISFP,
personal success depends upon the condition of their closest relationships, their aesthetic
environment and the development of their artistic creativity, their spiritual development,
and how much they feel valued and accepted for their individual contributions.`,
    strengths: [
      `Highly creative, artistic and spiritual, they can produce wonderful works of art,
music and literature. ISFP’s are natural artists. They will find great satisfaction if
they encourage and develop their artistic abilities. That doesn't mean that an ISFP
has to be a famous writer or painter in order to be content. Simply the act of
\`creating\` will be a fulfilling source of renewal and refreshment to the ISFP. An
ISFP should allow himself or herself some artistic outlet, because it will add
enrichment and positive energy to their life.`,
      `They're more spiritually aware than most people, and are more in touch with their
soul than others. Most ISFP’s have strong Faith. Those that don't may feel as if
they're missing something important. An ISFP should nourish their faith.`,
      `ISFP’s have an extremely well-developed ability to appreciate aesthetic qualities.
They're usually very aware of their environment, and can easily see what works
well and what doesn't from an aesthetic perspective. If they allow this strength to
flourish, they're likely to be stylish dressers who live in a home that's aesthetically
pleasing.`,
      `ISFP’s have passionate and intense feelings.`,
      `ISFP’s are very quick-witted and spatial in their thinking. If they have the desire,
they can be very good at individual sports like golf, skiing, biking, etc., because
they're extremely observant and have quick reactions.`,
      `They're usually good listeners who genuinely want to hear about someone's
problems, and genuinely want to help them. This makes them outstanding
counselors, and good friends. An ISFP may find great satisfaction from
volunteering as a counselor.`,
      `They accept and value people as individuals, and are strongly egalitarian. They
believe that an individual has the right to be themselves, without having their
attitudes and perspectives brought under scrutiny. Accordingly, they have a great
deal of tolerance and acceptance dealing with people who might encounter
negative judgment from society in general. They can see something positive in
everyone. They believe in individuals. If they give themselves the opportunity, an
ISFP can become a much-needed source of self-esteem and confidence for people
who cannot find it on their own. In this way, they can nurture a \`sick soul\` back
to health.`,
      `Practical and detail-oriented, ISFP’s are great at handling the details of a project.`,
      `ISFP’s live for the current day, and have an ability to enjoy the present moment
without stressing out about the future or the past.`,
      `They have a good ability to concentrate and focus. Accordingly, they can do well
in school if they set their mind to it.`,
    ],
    gifts: [
      `Their strongly passionate nature combined with their natural sense of aesthetic
beauty may make them gifted artists (such as Picasso, or Barbra Streisand, both
reportedly ISFP’s).`,
      `Their awareness of what's going on around them combined with their great
capacity to love will make them outstanding parents and caregivers.`,
      `They will quickly identify the opportunities of a situation, and quickly act to take
advantage of them. They will find that they're able to do anything that they put
their mind to, although they may not find it personally satisfying. Things may
seem to come easily to these ISFP’s. Although they're able to conquer many
different kinds of tasks and situations, these ISFP’s will be happiest doing
something that seems truly important to them. Although they may find that they
can achieve the \`mainstream\` type of success with relative ease, they are not
likely to find happiness along that path, unless they have especially rich and
rewarding personal relationships.`,
      `The ISFP who augments their strong, internal value system (Introverted Feeling)
with a well-developed ability to recognize opportunities (Extraverted Sensing)
can be a powerful force for social change.`,
    ],
    potentialProblemAreas: [
      `May be extremely sensitive to any kind of criticism`,
      `May be unable to see the opportunities inherent to a situation`,
      `May perceive criticism where none was intended`,
      `May have skewed or unrealistic ideas about reality`,
      `May be unable to acknowledge or hear anything that goes against their personal
ideas and opinions`,
      `May blame their problems on other people, seeing themselves as victims who are
treated unfairly`,
      `May have great anger, and show this anger with rash outpourings of bad temper`,
      `May be unaware of appropriate social behavior`,
      `May be oblivious to their personal appearance, or to appropriate dress`,
      `May come across as eccentric, or perhaps even generally strange to others,

      `May be unaware of how their behavior affects others`,
      `May be oblivious to other people's need`,
      `May feel overwhelmed with tension and stress when someone expresses
disagreement with the ISFP, or disapproval of the ISFP`,
      `May develop strong judgments that are difficult to change against people who
they perceive have been oppressive or suppressive to them`,
      `Under great stress, may feel out of control and fearful, dwelling on the \`dark side\`
of things`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common ISFP problem of only taking in data that justifies their personal
opinions. ISFP’s are usually very intense and sensitive people, and feel seriously
threatened by criticism. They are likely to treat any point of view other than their own as
criticism of their own perspective. If the ISFP does not learn how to deal with this
perceived criticism, the ISFP will begin to shut out the incoming information that causes
them pain. This is a natural survivalist technique for the ISFP personality. The main
driver to the ISFP personality is Introverted Feeling, whose purpose is to maintain and
honor an intensely personal system of values and morals. If an ISFP's personal value
system is threatened by external influences, the ISFP shuts out the threatening data in
order to preserve and honor their value system. This is totally natural, and works well to
protect the individual psyche from getting hurt. However, the ISFP who exercises this
type of self-protection regularly will become more and more unaware of other people's
perspectives, and thus more and more isolated from a real understanding of the world that
they live in. They will always find justification for their own inappropriate behaviors, and
will always find fault with the external world for problems that they have in their lives. It
will be difficult for them to maintain close personal relationships because they will have
unreasonable expectations, and will be unable to accept blame.
It’s not an uncommon tendency for the ISFP to look to the external world primarily for
information that will support their ideas and values. However, if this tendency is given
free reign, the resulting ISFP personality is too self-centered to be happy or successful.
Since the ISFP's dominant function to their personality is Introverted Feeling, they must
balance this with an auxiliary Extraverted Sensing function. The ISFP takes in
information via Extraverted Sensing. This is also the ISFP's primary way of dealing with
the external world. If the ISFP uses Extraverted Sensing only to serve the purposes of
Introverted Feeling, then the ISFP is not using Extraversion effectively at all. As a result,
the ISFP does not take in enough information about the external world to have a good
sense of what's going on. They see nothing but their own perspective, and deal with the
world only so far as they need to in order to support their perspective. These individuals
usually come across as selfish and unrealistic. Depending on how serious the problem is,
they may appear to be anything from "a bit eccentric" to "way out there". Many times
other people are unable to understand or relate to these people.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISFP needs to focus on opening their perspective to include
a more accurate picture of what is really going on in the world. In order to be in a
position in which the ISFP is able to perceive and consider data that is foreign to their
internal value system, the ISFP needs to know that its value system is not threatened by
the new information. The ISFP must consciously tell himself/herself that an opinion that
does not concede with their own is not an indictment of their entire character.
The ISFP who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to their
motivation for taking in information. Do they take in information to better understand a
situation or concept? Or, do they take in information to support a personal idea or cause?
At the moment when something is perceived, is the ISFP concerned with twisting that
perception to fit in with their personal values? Or is she/he concerned with absorbing the
information objectively? To achieve a better understanding of the external world, the
ISFP should try to perceive information objectively, before fitting it into their value
system. They should consciously be aware of their tendency to discard anything that
doesn't agree with their values, and work towards lessening this tendency. They should
try to see situations from other people's perspectives, without making personal judgments
about the situations or the other people's perspectives. In general, they should work on
exercising their Sensing in a truly Extraverted sense. In other words, they should use
Sensing to take in information about the world around them for the sake of understanding
the world, rather than take in information to support their own conclusions. The ISFP
who successfully perceives things objectively may be quite a powerful force for positive
change.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `Some ISFP’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are often a result of
an unawareness of appropriate social behavior, an unawareness of how they come across
to others, or unrealistic expectations of others. Any one of these three issues stem from
using Extraverted Sensing in a diminished manner. An ISFP who takes in information for
the sake of understanding the world around them, rather than one who takes in
information only to support their own ideas, will have a clearer, more objective
understanding of how society values social behaviors and attitudes. He or she will also be
more aware of how they are perceived by others, and will have more realistic
expectations for others' behavior within a relationship. Such well-adjusted ISFP’s will fit
happily into our society.
Unless you really understand Psychological Type and the nuances of the various
personality functions, it's a difficult task to suddenly start to use Sensing in an
Extraverted direction. It's difficult to even understand what that means, much less to
incorporate that directive into your life. With that in mind, I am providing some specific
suggestions that may help you to begin exercising your Extraverted Sensing more fully:
Take care to notice what people look like in different social situations. Look at their hair,
their skin, their makeup (or lack thereof), their clothes, the condition of their clothes, their
shoes, their facial expressions. Don't compare others to your own appearance, or pass
judgment on their appearance, simply take in the information.
Think of a situation in your life in which you weren't sure how to behave. Now try to
understand how one or two other people would see the situation. Don't compare their
behavior to your own, i.e. "she would know better than me what to do", or "why is it so
easy for her, but so hard for me". Rather, try to understand how they would see the
situation. Would it be seen as a problem, or as an opportunity? Would it be taken
seriously or lightly? Try to determine their point of view without passing judgment or
comparing it to your own.
When having a conversation with a friend or relative, dedicate at least half of your time
to talking about the other person. Concentrate on really understanding where that person
is coming from with their concerns. Ask questions.
Think of the people who are closest to you. As you think of each person, tell yourself
"this person has their own life going on, and they are more concerned with their own life
than they are with mine." Remember that this doesn't mean that they don't care about you.
It's the natural order of things. Try to visualize what that person is doing right now. What
things are they encountering, what thoughts are they having? Don't pass judgment, or
compare their situation to your own.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone that you come into contact with for any
length of time.`,
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Encourage your natural artistic abilities and creativity.
Nourish your spirituality. Give yourself opportunities to help the needy or
underprivileged.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! Realize and accept that some traits are strengths and
some are weaknesses. Facing and dealing with your weaknesses doesn't mean that
you have to change who you are, it means that you want to be the best You
possible. By facing your weaknesses, you are honoring your true self, rather than
attacking yourself.`,
      `Express Your Feelings. Don't let unexpressed emotions build up inside of you. If
you have strong feelings, sort them out and express them, Don't let them build up
inside you to the point where they become unmanageable!`,
      `Listen to Everything. Try not to dismiss anything immediately. Let everything
soak in for awhile, then apply judgment.`,
      `Smile at Criticism. Remember that people will not always agree with you or
understand you, even if they value you greatly. Try to see disagreement and
criticism as an opportunity for growth. In fact, that is exactly what it is.`,
      `Be Aware of Others. Remember that there are 15 other personality types out there
who see things differently than you see them. Try to identify other people's types.
Try to understand their perspectives.`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Remember that YOU have more control over your
life than any other person has.`,
      `Be Gentle in Your Expectations. You will always be disappointed with others if
you expect too much of them. Being disappointed with another person is the best
way to drive them away. Treat others with the same gentleness that you would
like to be treated with.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself by assuming the worst. Remember that a
positive attitude often creates positive situations.`,
      `When in Doubt, Ask Questions! Don't assume that the lack of feedback is the
same thing as negative feedback. If you need feedback and don't have any, ask for
it.`,

    type: "ISTJ",
    name: "Introverted Sensing Thinking Judging",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Sensing with Extraverted Thinking",
    epithet: "The Duty Fulfiller",
    description: `As an ISTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you take things in
via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion. Your secondary mode is external, where
you deal with things rationally and logically.
ISTJ's are quiet and reserved individuals who are interested in security and peaceful
living. They have a strongly-felt internal sense of duty, which lends them a serious air
and the motivation to follow through on tasks. Organized and methodical in their
approach, they can generally succeed at any task which they undertake.
ISTJ’s are very loyal, faithful, and dependable. They place great importance on honesty
and integrity. They are "good citizens" who can be depended on to do the right thing for
their families and communities. While they generally take things very seriously, they also
usually have an offbeat sense of humor and can be a lot of fun - especially at family or
work-related gatherings.
ISTJ’s tend to believe in laws and traditions, and expect the same from others. They're
not comfortable with breaking laws or going against the rules. If they are able to see a
good reason for stepping outside of the established mode of doing things, the ISTJ will
support that effort. However, ISTJ’s more often tend to believe that things should be done
according to procedures and plans. If an ISTJ has not developed their Intuitive side
sufficiently, they may become overly obsessed with structure, and insist on doing
everything "by the book".
The ISTJ is extremely dependable on following through with things which he or she has
promised. For this reason, they sometimes get more and more work piled on them.
Because the ISTJ has such a strong sense of duty, they may have a difficult time saying
"no" when they are given more work than they can reasonably handle. For this reason, the
ISTJ often works long hours, and may be unwittingly taken advantage of.
The ISTJ will work for long periods of time and put tremendous amounts of energy into
doing any task which they see as important to fulfilling a goal. However, they will resist
putting energy into things which don't make sense to them, or for which they can't see a
practical application. They prefer to work alone, but work well in teams when the
situation demands it. They like to be accountable for their actions, and enjoy being in
positions of authority. The ISTJ has little use for theory or abstract thinking, unless the
practical application is clear.
ISTJ’s have tremendous respect for facts. They hold a tremendous store of facts within
themselves, which they have gathered through their Sensing preference. They may have
difficulty understanding a theory or idea which is different from their own perspective.
However, if they are shown the importance or relevance of the idea to someone who they
respect or care about, the idea becomes a fact, which the ISTJ will internalize and
support. Once the ISTJ supports a cause or idea, he or she will stop at no lengths to
ensure that they are doing their duty of giving support where support is needed.
The ISTJ is not naturally in tune with their own feelings and the feelings of others. They
may have difficulty picking up on emotional needs immediately, as they are presented.
Being perfectionists themselves, they have a tendency to take other people's efforts for
granted, like they take their own efforts for granted. They need to remember to pat people
on the back once in a while.
ISTJ’s are likely to be uncomfortable expressing affection and emotion to others.
However, their strong sense of duty and the ability to see what needs to be done in any
situation usually allows them to overcome their natural reservations, and they are usually
quite supporting and caring individuals with the people that they love. Once the ISTJ
realizes the emotional needs of those who are close to them, they put forth effort to meet
those needs.
The ISTJ is extremely faithful and loyal. Traditional and family-minded, they will put
forth great amounts of effort at making their homes and families running smoothly. They
are responsible parents, taking their parenting roles seriously. They are usually good and
generous providers to their families. They care deeply about those close to them,
although they usually are not comfortable with expressing their love. The ISTJ is likely to
express their affection through actions, rather than through words.
ISTJ’s have an excellent ability to take any task and define it, organize it, plan it, and
implement it through to completion. They are very hard workers, who do not allow
obstacles to get in the way of performing their duties. They do not usually give
themselves enough credit for their achievements, seeing their accomplishments simply as
the natural fulfillment of their obligations.
ISTJ’s usually have a great sense of space and function, and artistic appreciation. Their
homes are likely to be tastefully furnished and immaculately maintained. They are
acutely aware of their senses, and want to be in surroundings which fit their need for
structure, order, and beauty.
Under stress, ISTJ’s may fall into "catastrophe mode", where they see nothing but all of
the possibilities of what could go wrong. They will berate themselves for things which
they should have done differently, or duties which they failed to perform. They will lose
their ability to see things calmly and reasonably, and will depress themselves with their
visions of doom.
In general, the ISTJ has a tremendous amount of potential. Capable, logical, reasonable,
and effective individuals with a deeply driven desire to promote security and peaceful
living, the ISTJ has what it takes to be highly effective at achieving their chosen goals -
whatever they may be.`,

    successDefinition: `People with the ISTJ personality type are serious, methodical, analytical, and hard working. They store knowledge gained from their experiences, and use this knowledge to
tackle new problems and ideas. They will work a problem through to its identified
conclusion. They work towards defined goals; their analytical objectivity gives them the
tendency to make goal-oriented decisions that are not waylaid by the concerns of
individuals. They're uncomfortable with ideas that are completely new to them, or that
are totally theoretical in nature. Since they have no direct experience with the new
concept, they have no tools for knowing how to deal with it or what to think about it.
They need to get the framework for a new concept before they're able to deal with it. An
experienced ISTJ is usually a very capable person, and makes an excellent manager.
ISTJ’s have great value for the "tried and true" approach, and are reluctant to adopt new
systems until direct experience proves the validity of the new system. They internalize
and value the rules and structure of the society in which they live, and disapprove of
behaviors that go against these rules. ISTJ’s highly value the cornerstone institutions of
society such as Family, Work, and Church. Their hard-working, dedicated nature is
especially well-suited for holding up such institutions. An ISTJ's feeling of success
depends upon being able to use their experience for the benefit of an institution, and also
upon the level of structure and lack of chaos in their life, and in the health and welfare of
their family or other social structure.`,

    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common ISTJ problem of Introverted Sensing overtaking the ISTJ's
personality to the point that all other functions become slaves to Introverted Sensing. A
more "whole" personality needs to have a good balance between its dominant and
auxiliary functions. For an ISTJ, the dominant Introverted Sensing needs to be well supported by the auxiliary Extraverted Thinking function. If Extraverted Thinking exists
only to support the desires of Introverted Sensing, than neither function is being used to
its potential.
Introverted Sensing is a personality function that constantly gathers data and stores it in a
sort of informational database to be accessed at will in the future. As the dominant player
in a personality, it has the effect of constantly bombarding the psyche with facts to store.
As something new is perceived, it is added to the vast warehouse of Introverted Sensing
data. Introverted Sensing does not in itself analyze this data for meaning or connection--it
just takes it in as information. In order to sort through and make use of this information, a
judging function must be applied. It is the judging function that does the analysis and
ordering of the data.
When Introverted Sensing is too dominant, or Extraverted Thinking is not developed
sufficiently, we see the ISTJ using Extraverted Thinking to order the individual's world in
such a way that Introverted Sensing can reign without interference. This may include
dismissing the importance of relationships, or pushing away anything that threatens the
ISTJ's highly introverted way of life. In this manner, Extraverted Thinking is used against
the external world, rather than against the ISTJ's internal data. It is a defensive shield,
rather than a useful filter.
The better, more "whole" use of Extraverted Thinking for the ISTJ would be to use it to
order and evaluate its own rich store of data, and therefore generate useful solutions to
problems and efficient systems. Like all types, most ISTJ’s will show some signs of this
kind of weakness. This does not mean that they're hopelessly flawed. The real problems
occur when an ISTJ personality has become so imbalanced that its owner is extremely
selfish and unable to consider the importance or validity of anyone else's perspective.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISTJ needs to focus on applying their judgment against
information that they have gathered, rather than against single facts or ideas coming from
others. Before judging, put all new data into the context of existing facts. Working with
all of the facts at your disposal will greatly improve your ability to judge effectively, and
will reduce the likelihood that you will become offensively reactionary and isolationist.
An ISTJ who is concerned with personal growth will pay close attention to the subject of
there judgments, and their motivations for making judgments. Are they judging
something external to themselves, or are they judging something within the context of
their stored knowledge? Is the motivation for judging something to be able to understand
its usefulness in the world, or to dismiss it? Too often, an ISTJ will judge something
without properly understanding it, and with the intention of dismissing it. Seek first to
understand, then to judge.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `People of all personality types sometimes experience problems dealing with specific
aspects of civilization and human interaction. For the ISTJ, problems are generally
associated with being unable to tolerate behaviors that go outside perceived norms, and
with not putting forth effort to meet others' emotional needs. These problems stem from
building up the importance of the ISTJ's inner world and diminishing the importance of
the external world. ISTJ’s who recognize that their knowledge and experience can be
enriched by the synergy of other people's knowledge and experience will find that they
can be committed to their internal worlds and still have satisfying relationships with
others. The key to accomplishing this is development of their highest extraverted
function, Extraverted Thinking.
An ISTJ who uses Extraverted Thinking to find fault externally rather than internally may
become so strongly opinionated that they form rigid and unreasonable expectations of
others. Their hyper-vigilant judgments about the rationality and competence of others
may be a very effective way of keeping themselves at an emotional distance from others.
This will preserve the sanctity of the ISTJ's inner world and lifestyle, but will reduce a lot
of valuable input, arrest the development of their social character, and stagnate the
development of the ISTJ's rich store of experiential data. In extreme cases the ISTJ may
find him or herself quite alone and lonely.
More commonly, the ISTJ will run into trouble when they try to order and structure the
outer world, rather than their inner world. Trying to structure people into a predefined,
acceptable system is problematic. The personality types who value the unique individual
will be offended by the apparent lack of respect for their person, and people with
personality types who follow social values will want to be honoring their own system,
rather then being forced to follow yours. Many people experience being controlled or
manipulated as a form of suppression, and resist it. Eventually, they may harbor serious
resentment against the suppressor.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Take care to listen to someone's idea entirely before you pass judgment on it. Ask
questions if necessary. Do whatever it takes to make sure that you understand the idea.
Try not to begin judging anything until you understand the details.
Try to identify the personality type of everyone you encounter frequently in your life.
Remember that Intuitives often have a wandering style of expression. Try to exhibit
tolerance for this.
Before you begin talking to another person, pause for a moment and look at that person.
Take in that person's attitude and feelings at that moment. Be aware of the person with
whom you are speaking.`,

    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Do things that allow your excellent organizational and
logical abilities to flourish. Explore the worlds of business management,
accounting, and medicine.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! See your weaknesses for what they are, and seek to
overcome them. Especially, strive to use your judgment against your internal store
of knowledge, rather than as a means of disregarding other people's ideas.`,
      `Talk Through Your Thoughts. You need to step through your vast amount of
information in order to put things into perspective. Give yourself appropriate time
to do this, and take advantage of discussing ideas with others. Some find that
externalizing your thoughts is a valuable exercise, as is expressing your ideas
clearly in writing.`,
      `Take in Everything. Don't dismiss ideas prematurely because you don't respect the
person generating the ideas, or because you think you already know it all. After
all, everybody has something to offer, and nobody knows everything. As Steven
Covey says, \`Seek first to understand, and then to be understood.\``,
      `Quench Your Desire to Control Others. Remember that most people do not want
to be controlled. Again, turn your controlling tendencies inwardly rather than
outwardly. You can only really control yourself.`,
      `Be Aware of Others. Take time to notice where others are coming from. What is
their personality type? How are they currently feeling?`,
      `Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other
people. Look inwardly for solutions.`,
      `Be Gentle in Your Expectations, and judge yourself at least as harshly as you
judge others.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling on the dark side
of everything. Just as there is a positive charge for every negative charge, there is
a light side to every dark side. Remember that positive situations are created by
positive attitudes, and vice versa. Expect the best, and the best will come forward.`,
      `There is Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself. Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk to
initiate change. Don't be afraid to do so when that time comes. In most cases, the
obstacles and burdens standing in the way of your goal are not really there--they
just exist in your perspective. Change your perspective--change your life.`,

    type: "ISTP",
    name: "Introverted Sensing Thinking Perceiving",
    nameDescription: "Introverted Thinking with Extraverted Sensing",
    epithet: "The Mechanic",
    description: `As an ISTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal with
things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you take things
in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.
ISTP's have a compelling drive to understand the way things work. They're good at
logical analysis, and like to use it on practical concerns. They typically have strong
powers of reasoning, although they're not interested in theories or concepts unless they
can see a practical application. They like to take things apart and see the way they work.
ISTP’s have an adventuresome spirit. They are attracted to motorcycles, airplanes, sky
diving, surfing, etc. They thrive on action, and are usually fearless. ISTP’s are fiercely
independent, needing to have the space to make their own decisions about their next step.
They do not believe in or follow rules and regulations, as this would prohibit their ability
to "do their own thing". Their sense of adventure and desire for constant action makes
ISTP’s prone to becoming bored rather quickly.
ISTP’s are loyal to their causes and beliefs, and are firm believers that people should be
treated with equity and fairness. Although they do not respect the rules of the "System",
they follow their own rules and guidelines for behavior faithfully. They will not take part
in something which violates their personal laws. ISTP’s are extremely loyal and faithful
to their "brothers".
ISTP’s like and need to spend time alone, because this is when they can sort things out in
their minds most clearly. They absorb large quantities of impersonal facts from the
external world, and sort through those facts, making judgments, when they are alone.
ISTP’s are action-oriented people. They like to be up and about, doing things. They are
not people to sit behind a desk all day and do long-range planning. Adaptable and
spontaneous, they respond to what is immediately before them. They usually have strong
technical skills, and can be effective technical leaders. They focus on details and practical
things. They have an excellent sense of expediency and grasp of the details which enables
them to make quick, effective decisions.
ISTP’s avoid making judgments based on personal values - they feel that judgments and
decisions should be made impartially, based on the fact. They are not naturally tuned in
to how they are affecting others. They do not pay attention to their own feelings, and
even distrust them and try to ignore them, because they have difficulty distinguishing
between emotional reactions and value judgments. This may be a problem area for many
ISTP’s.
An ISTP who is over-stressed may exhibit rash emotional outbursts of anger, or on the
other extreme may be overwhelmed by emotions and feelings which they feel compelled
to share with people (often inappropriately). An ISTP who is down on themselves will
foray into the world of value judgments - a place which is not natural for the ISTP - and
judge themselves by their inability to perform some task. They will then approach the
task in a grim emotional state, expecting the worst.
ISTP’s are excellent in a crisis situations. They're usually good athletes, and have very
good hand-eye coordination. They are good at following through with a project, and tying
up loose ends. They usually don't have much trouble with school, because they are
introverts who can think logically. They are usually patient individuals, although they
may be prone to occasional emotional outbursts due to their inattention to their own
feelings.
ISTP’s have a lot of natural ability which makes them good at many different kinds of
things. However, they are happiest when they are centered in action-oriented tasks which
require detailed logical analysis and technical skill. They take pride in their ability to take
the next correct step.
ISTP’s are optimistic, full of good cheer, loyal to their equals, uncomplicated in their
desires, generous, trusting and receptive people who want no part in confining
commitments.`,

    successDefinition: `People with the ISTP personality type are action-oriented thinkers. They are highly tuned
into their immediate environment, and driven to interact with it in a hands-on fashion. It
is by working with things in their environment that they experience and understand life.
By working physically with their environment, they have a natural and immediate
understanding of how things work, and how best to achieve their identified goals.
Although they constantly use logic to determine how to best manipulate objects in their
immediate situation, they are not naturally analytical in a more objective sense. When
they step back to methodically analyze the relationship between objects in their world,
they often lose touch with their understanding. Their understanding is intimately tied into
their physical experience with reality. It is immediate and holistic. They are naturally "in sync" with the physical world, and value life largely in terms of their ability to flow with
and conquer the physical challenges presented to them. Although they think about and
value past experiences, they live almost entirely in the here and now. ISTP’s are natural
mechanics, athletes, musicians, technicians, and engineers. They excel at tasks that
require a great deal of tactile mastery, as well as quick, logic-based action. ISTP’s are
most comfortable using their known skills, rather than being thrown into situations with
which they have no personal experience. The nuances of variation in each individual
situation will bring a sense of newness and freshness to the experience for the ISTP.
ISTP’s often resist and rebel situations that are entirely new, or that require a great deal
of structured planning and thinking. This way of thinking is foreign to the ISTP, and
therefore uncomfortable. When someone tries to push or control the ISTP into these
situations, he or she is likely to "walk away" from that person without looking back.
Their resistance to structure may cause them to quit school early, quit jobs that they find
stifling, or quit relationships that have too many expectations. ISTP’s are often likeable
and have more friends and social interaction than is normal for an Introvert. The ISTP
genuinely enjoys the company of their friends, and needs their input in his or her physical
world to maintain their understanding of their own place in the world. An ISTP's feeling
of success is dependent primarily upon their mastery of their physical world, but is also
dependent upon the existence of strong, reliable, interpersonal relationships. Without
these relationships, the ISTP is likely to avoid relationships, isolate him or herself, and
feel very vulnerable to rejection and hurt.`,
    strengths: [
      `They have a natural ability to focus and \`become one\` with their immediate
environment. This ability allows them to be great athletes, dancers, and
musicians. They have an innately graceful connection with the physical world.`,
      `They are highly in tune with their physical surroundings, and therefore have well developed aesthetic appreciation. They appreciate beauty. If they are so inclined,
they may develop their ability to control the physical world into some form of art
expression, and become artists.`,
      `They are exceptional troubleshooters in emergency situations. They can quickly
take in the current situation and apply logic immediately to take steps that control
the problem. Since the ISTP's use of logic is based on their personal experience,
their ability to troubleshoot will get better and better as they gain more
experience. For this reason, ISTP’s who are mechanics, technicians, and computer
analysts (for example) often achieve \`guru\` status after they have been working in
the field for a long time.`,
      `They're very sensual and earthy people. They usually a good deal of sex appeal
and attractive sensuality.`,
    ],
    gifts: [
      `They have attractive and compelling personalities, and are well-liked and
accepted by most people.`,
      `They're usually quite intelligent, and can work through difficult problems.`,
      `They understand the benefits of close relationships, and understand how to
support and enhance these relationships.`,
      `They can handle just about any task that they are presented with.`,
    ],
    potentialProblemAreas: [
      `The ISTP gets \`stuck in a rut\` and only does those things that are known and
comfortable to the ISTP.`,
      `The ISTP resists and rejects anything that doesn't support their own experiential
understanding of the world. If there is a conflict between their own way of life
and something that they encounter, they don't perceive that \`something\` in an
objective sense. Rather, they reject it to avoid conflict and to preserve the sanctity
of their inner world.`,
      `They choose to surround themselves with people who support their own way of
life, and reject people who think or live differently.`,
      `They may become overly paranoid about social organizations and institutions
trying to control them.`,
      `They may unknowingly or uncaringly hurt people's feelings.`,
      `They may be completely unaware of how to express their inner world to others in
a meaningful way.`,
      `They may be completely unaware of the type of communication that is often
desirable and (to some degree) expected in an intimate relationship. If they are
aware of the kinds of things that are appropriate to say and do to foster emotional
bonding, they may be unable to appreciate the value of such actions. They may
feel too vulnerable to express themselves in this fashion, and so reject the entire
idea.`,
      `If pushed beyond their comfort level to form commitments or emotional bonds,
they may reject a relationship entirely.`,
      `Under stress, they may show intense emotions that seem disproportionate to the
situation.`,
    ],
    explanationOfProblems: `Nearly all of the problematic characteristics described above can be attributed in various
degrees to the common ISTP problem of only taking in information that relates to or
supports their own life experience. The ISTP is driven to work with and understand his or
her world by applying their special brand of logic (an immediate, spatial, "fuzzy" logic)
to their physical experience. They don't necessarily have a goal in mind to achieve from
this process - it is the process itself that is rewarding to the ISTP. In their zeal for the
satisfaction that comes from mastering their physical environment in such a way, ISTP’s
often selectively choose to put themselves in situations in which they have the
opportunity to exercise these skills. That's certainly not a problem. Most personality types
choose to do the things that they're best at most often. Such is the nature of capitalizing
upon our strengths. The problem rears its ugly head when the goal of the ISTP becomes
to achieve their personal satisfaction at all costs.
It is healthy to choose your paths and goals in life so that they coincide with what you
find rewarding, and what you're really good at. However, it sometimes happens that we
take this approach a bit too far and sacrifice an accurate and objective understanding of
the world for a more narrow vision that is easier and comfortable for us to deal with. The
ISTP affects this problem when they stop taking in information in a truly objective sense,
and instead only take in information that supports their way of life.
The dominant function of the ISTP is Introverted Thinking. This function is supported
closely and importantly by the auxiliary function of Extraverted Sensing. Extraverted
Sensing perceives the world and sends information into the psyche, where it is processed
by Introverted Thinking. An ISTP who uses their Extraverted Sensing function in a
diminished way is one who chooses to restrict their environment to people and places that
support their favored activities. In such a way, the ISTP prevents his or her psyche from
having to consider data from differing viewpoints and lifestyles, and thus promotes a
lifestyle that allows them to frequently exercise and enhance their known tactile skills. It
serves their immediate needs, which are the primary focus of the ISTP. However, it also
promotes a lifestyle that is essentially self-centered and narrow in focus. It solves short term problems, and creates long-term ones.
The ISTP's inferior (fourth) function is Extraverted Feeling. This means that the ISTP is
not naturally in tune with how other people are feeling, or with social expectations. In
fact, the ISTP is likely to reject the importance of social rituals, rules, and expectations.
This is a natural weak point for the ISTP, which no doubt causes strife to the ISTP and
their love partner. This weakness can be overcome by developing their Extraverted
Sensing to the point that they can perceive Feeling type expectations in the external
world. They don't have to use Extraverted Feeling to understand how to act in situations.
They can perceive the expected behavior from their Extraverted Sensing function.
However, if they are restricting their incoming data to only those things that support their
existing way of life, then they are not learning from Extraverted Sensing at all. They are
not growing their understanding of social and intimate behaviors - rather, they are
reducing the importance of this type of understanding to their own life. In these
situations, ISTP’s shy away from very close personal relationships, and feel more
vulnerable and less sure of themselves in situations that involve expressing their
emotions.`,
    solutions: `To grow as an individual, the ISTP needs to focus on taking in as much information as
possible through Extraverted Sensing. He or she needs to allow themselves to get into
situations that they aren't necessarily comfortable with, or that are different from the
situations that they would normally choose in life. The ISTP learns from experience, so
the best way for the ISTP to grow as a person is to open him or herself to new
experiences. Be aware of the tendency to want to run out and do something "new" that is
actually just a different opportunity to exercise a known skill. Your task, as a person
interested in personal growth, is to understand the world in a truly objective fashion,
rather than understanding how the world fits in with your way of life.`,
    livingHappilyTips: `ISTP’s usually have a loyal group of friends that they fit in with and feel comfortable
with. The problems that ISTP’s have with regards to fitting into our world are not usually
related to platonic friendships. Usually, the ISTP has trouble finding and maintaining a
love relationship. The ISTP usually has very simple needs and expectations from their
mates, and they're surprised and confused to find that their mates have more complex
demands. They feel inadequate to meeting their mate's needs, and begin to get very
uncomfortable with the situation as they perceive that they are expected to do something
that it unknown to them. They back away from the relationship. Outside of a relationship,
they feel more unloved and unappreciated, but are afraid to commit to a relationship
because they fear rejection and hurt.`,
    suggestions: [
      `Don't expect yourself to be a master at the "touchy-feely" game. Be yourself, but
remember that there is a basic assumption of human decency that must be adhered to in
relationships. If you're not sure what that means, take special care to observe how people
in "good" committed relationships behave towards each other, so that you can determine
where the lines are drawn.
Pair yourself with an Extraverted Thinker (ESTJ or ENTJ) who is less likely to assume
that the lack of feedback is the same thing as negative feedback.
Expanding your world and experiences will expand your understanding of human
expectations. Try to figure out the personality type of people that you know and
encounter in your life.
Don't fear the unknown. You can handle it`,
    ],
    tenRulesToLive: [
      `Feed Your Strengths! Realize your gift at mastering your physical environment,
and give yourself plenty of opportunities to exercise your abilities. Ride, play,
paint, work it. Much of your sense of well-being will come from these
experiences.`,
      `Face Your Weaknesses! Face your fear of the unknown, and get yourself into new
situations. Experience new activities and people with new perspectives. Don't
isolate yourself into a narrow and lonely existence.`,
      `Talk About Your Thoughts. Discussing your ideas and perceptions with others
will help you to develop your Extraverted Sensing, and thus your understanding
of the world. How well you use your auxiliary function is very important to your
overall health and happiness.`,
      `Don't Be Afraid to Love. That's just your old inferior function trying to convince
you that you're unloved and unlovable. It's not true. Just because you're not sure
what to do with yourself doesn't mean that you can't learn! Go on... jump in. The
water's warm.`,
      `Respect Your Need for Action. Understand that you need to be actively working
with your environment to be \`in the groove\` with life. Don't chastise yourself for
not being the sort to sit around and read a book or watch a movie. Choose a
partner and companions who value active lifestyles.`,
      `Recognize Social Principles. Realize that our society functions around some basic
social principles, and that our society would fail unless those principles are
recognized and upheld. In a democracy, people vote. At a red stoplight, people
stop. If people stopped voting because it wasn't important to their own way of life,
who would be in power? If people stopped stopping at red stop lights because it
didn't fit into their way of life, how could we drive safely? Your priorities and
beliefs are important, but you must recognize that the external world's agenda is
also important. Don't dismiss the importance of principles that don't affect your
life directly.`,
      `It's OK to Get Out of your Comfort Zone. Understand that the only way to grow is
to get outside of your comfort zone. If you're uncomfortable with an idea or
situation because you're not sure how to act, that's good! That's an opportunity for
growth.`,
      `Identify and Express Your Feelings. You may have a hard time figuring out
exactly how you feel about someone that you're involved with. It's important that
you do figure this out. Don't lead someone on with your ambivalence. If you
determine that you value the person, tell them so every time you think of it. This
is the best way to make them feel secure in your affections, and so to promote a
long-lasting relationship.`,
      `Be Aware of Others. Try to really identify where people are coming from. Their
ideas, thoughts and priorities are different from yours. They have something to
offer you. Try to identify their personality types.`,
      `Assume the Best. Don't distress yourself with fear and dark imaginings. Expect
the best, and the best will come.`,
